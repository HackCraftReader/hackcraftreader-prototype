And at that time, just dealing with the tools -- typically on a mainframe -- was the first couple weeks of the typical introductory programming course.</p><p>This is not entirely unusual, even today. I was curious about one of the toolchains for phone app development.

Why should I assume we&#x27;re even talking about data types?</p><p>I have fond memories of learning to program as a kid. Concepts like trees, nodes, and data types have no place in an introductory programming for kids. The initial idea to teach is the notion of getting the machine to follow a set of instructions. IMHO even functions should not be forced until that notion of writing instructions for the computer to follow is mastered. Imperative is the word I&#x27;m looking for. You need to start with that. Then move on to loops, arrays (or list but don&#x27;t try to explain the difference for a while), functions. You don&#x27;t want to require any of the concepts that we all take for granted just to get started. Type systems? structures? Objects? Those need to be introduced through examples where they are used to solve specific problems.</p><p>I have some examples of how an absolute beginner may think.</p><p>I was learning about BASIC and had worked up (yeah up) to using FOR loops, IF and GOTO. Then I read about the PLOT(h,v) function which would light up a pixel on the screen - awesomeness was about to ensue. But I had the notion that - as the instruction said - I had to pass the variable h and v to that function, not whatever pair I choose. That would mean copying values from other variables (i.e. h=x, v=y, plot(h,v) and then h=i, v=k, plot(h,v)). Fortunately that notion got cleared up very quickly, but it illustrates the point that a noob may take something quite literally and not understand the simplest abstractions that we all take for granted.</p><p>On another occasion I wanted to write Pac-Man so I had variables (we didn&#x27;t even had structures available) for the player and I figured I&#x27;d use x1,y1, x2,y2, x3,y3, x4,y4 to track the positions of the ghosts. I could see in advance that I&#x27;d have to replicate the ghost logic 4 times using different variables in each instance (or write a subroutine and copy variables around like I suggested above). What I wanted was to put the logic inside a loop (for n=1 to 4) and reference the ghost variable as xn, yn but that wouldn&#x27;t work because those are just different 2-letter variables. So I asked someone if there was a way to solve this and was pointed to arrays. The notion that a construct existed that matched exactly what I wanted to do was amazing and I felt like I really must understand something if my ideas about what should be possible were already there. Try to imagine that type of discovery compared to being presented a bunch of such concepts and being expected to understand form the start.</p><p>When I got to college I figured I already knew programming. Hah! The data structures course was incredible, I could already see how all of that stuff could be applied to different things. It made perfect sense because I could already imagine how to use it in all kinds of situations.</p><p>Even the most simple concepts need to be taught slowly at first, and preferably to solve a specific problem. If your language requires too much boilerplate, type definitions, or anything else it&#x27;s too much.</p><p>So when I said this language looked like a bunch of gibberish, I was looking at it through the lens of a kid who doesn&#x27;t know shit about any of this.

It&#x27;s just a historical accident that indexing traditionally started with one, and most languages lack a word for an ordinal number corresponding to zero. That&#x27;s mostly because for a long time zero hasn&#x27;t even been recognised as a number at all.</p><p>But the Ancient Greeks didn&#x27;t recognise 1 as a number either.

Integer intervals are closed intervals, thus conclusively proving this importance.</p><p>Half-open intervals preserve the property that [a,b) ∪ [b,c) = [a,c) whether the domain is discrete or not. Half-open intervals generalise well both to empty ranges and infinite ones.

Failure to find an element might just as well be represented by a null; that the value chosen to represent it is an integer smaller than any valid index is mostly an accident.

For one, because it generalises well to maps of arbitrary type.)

So, for example, if you need to slice an array, starting from the Nth, and up to and including the Nth from the end, and your slice syntax is end-inclusive (as is typical for 1-based approach), you get something like:</p><p><pre><code>   a[N : length(a) - N + 1]\n</code></pre>\nHowever, if you do have such special support - e.g. if negative indices are treated as from-the-end (like Python does), then it&#x27;s just:</p><p><pre><code>   a[N : -N]\n</code></pre>\nCompare this to 0-based N with end-exclusive slices (again, as is typical). If you don&#x27;t have reverse indexing, it&#x27;s slightly simpler:</p><p><pre><code>   a[N : length(a)]\n</code></pre>\nbut with reverse indexing (where -1 is the last element), it&#x27;s actually worse:</p><p><pre><code>   a[N : -N - 1]\n</code></pre>\nFWIW, most of it has more to do with the fact that 1) negative numbers are probably not the best way to represent reverse indices, and 2) depending on the situation, either end-inclusive or end-exclusive can be convenient.</p><p>In fact, merely having a special syntax for reverse indexing solves it for 0-based languages. For example, suppose that we extend the slice syntax such that either index can be prefixed with ~ to indicate indexing from the end. Then ~0 is the last element, and it becomes:</p><p><pre><code>   a[N : ~N]\n </code></pre>\nThis has a side benefit of avoiding errors when the computed index is <i>accidentally</i> negative, and ends up being treated as reverse, even though that was not actually the intent. Encoding the direction in the slice syntax itself means no runtime magic.</p><p>Alternatively, you can provide syntactic sugar for the length of the array within the indexer - say, `$`. Then, in 0-based end-exclusive approach, you just write:</p><p><pre><code>   a[N : $ - N]\n</code></pre>\nThis is one case that 1-based approach doesn&#x27;t handle nearly as well, because for the same simple syntax to work there, you&#x27;d need to make $ be length + 1, which is kinda ugly.</p><p>However, this only works if your ranges aren&#x27;t first-class (i.e. if they only appear inside []). These days, the trend seems to be to have ranges as first-class values in the language, and have the indexer accept a range as an operand. In that case, since the range can be constructed separately, it needs to be able to encode &quot;index from start&quot; and &quot;index from end&quot; inside the object itself, and special range syntax for that makes more sense.</p><p>If the language uses iterators or equivalent, then the iterator itself can encode the direction, and the range is just a pair of iterators. But you would still want some special short syntax, or at least a short convenience function, to easily create reverse iterators. C++ does just that - a pair of iterators expressing the same thing for random-access container `a` would be:</p><p><pre><code>   make_pair(a.begin() + N, a.rbegin() + N)\n</code></pre>\nThis is very generic, but the annoyance here is that you have to repeat `a` twice, and it could be a lengthy expression, or even have side effects. Some form of let..in syntax to introduce local bindings in expressions, like ML does, would help a lot here - you could do e.g.:</p><p><pre><code>   let a = &lt;some very long expression&gt;\n   in make_pair(a.begin() + N, a.rbegin() + N)</code></pre></p>","points":null,"parent_id":13187082,"story_id":13186225,"children":[]}]},{"id":13186898,"created_at_i":1481826912,"type":"comment","author":"jacobolus","text":"<p>The last item of an array should be simply arr[-1].

Why would counting in bytes make any more sense? The size of a byte (or a char, rather) is mostly an arbitrary implementation detail that abstract code shouldn&#x27;t be bothered with.</p><p>BTW, what you write is kindof wrong: As per the abstract definition of the language, nothing is being multiplied by sizeof()s. That tends to be how it&#x27;s often implemented on the usual platforms, but the abstract definition simply says that arithmetic with pointers works in units of elements, and that consistently: If you subtract pointers, you get the number of elements between them, not the number of bytes&#x2F;chars&#x2F;octets&#x2F;words&#x2F;whatever between them, the internal value is not really visible anywhere, and could relate to the abstract value in arbitrarily complicated ways anyway (like, you could have pointers that are implemented with tags to differentiate pointers to different machine address spaces and stuff like that).</p><p>&gt; that you can&#x27;t create a short︎＊-typed variable containing a non-short-stride-aligned memory-address...</p><p>That&#x27;s actually not the goal nor the case. Whether a pointer is aligned is an implementation detail, there is nothing in C that would require short objects to be aligned to short boundaries, and what implementations do simply depends on (a) whether the platform can handle non-aligned pointers, and (b) if it can, what makes sense as a matter of weighing performance vs. memory usage. I haven&#x27;t checked it, but my guess would be that the AVR GCC, for example, does not align anything, because it only needs more memory and makes no difference whatsoever for performance (I think ... maybe I am forgetting something).</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13188914,"story_id":13186225,"children":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"id":13187452,"created_at_i":1481830361,"type":"comment","author":"anigbrowl","text":"<p><i>There is nothing that inherently links &quot;one&quot; to &quot;first&quot;, or &quot;two&quot; to &quot;second&quot;</i></p><p>$10 says you don&#x27;t have any children.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13187351,"story_id":13186225,"children":[]},{"id":13187728,"created_at_i":1481831962,"type":"comment","author":"gshubert17","text":"<p>In my teaching I try to distinguish between conventional-language numbering by saying &quot;first&quot;, &quot;second&quot;, &quot;third&quot;; from zero-based indexing by saying &quot;zero-th&quot;, &quot;one-th&quot;, &quot;two-th&quot;, and so on.</p><p>It&#x27;s a bit awkward, but once explained it is a quick way to tell the two numbering schemes apart.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13187351,"story_id":13186225,"children":[{"id":13187787,"created_at_i":1481832299,"type":"comment","author":"sparky_z","text":"<p>...unless you&#x27;re working with indexes higher than 3.

There can pass an array as an argument to a parameter of a subroutine, and the subroutine can address the darned array\nany way it wants.   Why?  Sure, maybe want to sort the array based on a <i>slice</i> here omitting details.  Sure, such programming would need a lot of well done documentation and still is dangerous.  And such array fooling around stands to get into trouble with compiler options to check array bounds.</p><p>Then I did a lot with PL&#x2F;I:  There get arrays, structures, structures of arrays of structures of arrays, etc.  Also get to set the lower and upper bounds of each array index to anything -- positive, negative, or zero, including during execution -- that can be represented in the usually 16 bit array indexing arithmetic.  And, it turns out, all that array indexing, even for arrays of structures of arrays, etc., is just ordinary multi-dimensional array arithmetic -- nearly as useful as objects but with much simpler storage allocation and array indexing.  And if look carefully at that arithmetic, then do see how to have any subscript (index) lower bounds and upper bounds with just trivial modification of the usual array indexing.</p><p>And, yes, when I wrote C code, no way did I like the high emphasis on starting an array at index 0.  Besides C doesn&#x27;t even really support arrays, e.g., with several subscripts, and forces a programmer to write a macro or some such that does the arithmetic.  And there are problems in a subroutine that receives such an array.  And compiler support for checking array bounds is in trouble because the language syntax and semantics don&#x27;t even support arrays with several dimensions.  So, have to write, say, a <i>matrix</i> package that has a C structure for the details of number of dimensions and the upper&#x2F;lower bounds for each dimension -- it works but get no compiler based debugging support or I&#x2F;O support, and no doubt the compiler can&#x27;t do some indexing optimizations that Fortran and PL&#x2F;I can do because the data being used for the indexing is, in the semantics, not subject to being changed by the user&#x27;s code during the indexing arithmetic.  E.g., with PL&#x2F;I, in the <i>execution logic</i>, each structure or array, each <i>aggregate</i> has a little table, a <i>dope vector</i> that describes the aggregate, yes, within a subroutine and within runtime subroutines, e.g., for doing I&#x2F;O on the whole aggregate.</p><p>PL&#x2F;I was in good shape before C was developed.  PL&#x2F;I was used for the operating systems Multics and much of Primos.  So, PL&#x2F;I offers programmers much more than C and, still, is good for both applications and operating system code, especially in array indexing.</p><p>Sorry, Dijkstra.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13186780,"story_id":13186225,"children":[{"id":13187965,"created_at_i":1481833400,"type":"comment","author":"drivers99","text":"<p>C supports multidimensional arrays.</p><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learnxinyminutes.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;c&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learnxinyminutes.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;c&#x2F;</a> then text seach for &quot;dimensional&quot;.</p><p>More detail: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;beginnersbook.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;01&#x2F;2d-arrays-in-c-example&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;beginnersbook.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;01&#x2F;2d-arrays-in-c-example&#x2F;</a></p>","points":null,"parent_id":13187637,"story_id":13186225,"children":[{"id":13191115,"created_at_i":1481863159,"type":"comment","author":"graycat","text":"<p>Thanks.</p><p>I didn&#x27;t see that in K&amp;R, 1988.

The outer permiter shows blocks of time for the next 12 hours where something is scheduled and it&#x27;s pretty cool. I didn&#x27;t find any other faces that had quite the same functionality, but I think I could build one using one of the custom watch face apps, I just haven&#x27;t bothered to spend the time yet.</p><p>I don&#x27;t use the fitness tracking on it. An interesting side effect though is that my phone counts more steps. When I&#x27;m sitting at my desk, I tend to take my watch off but keep my phone in my pocket -- so if I get up to go to someone else&#x27;s desk, bathroom or get coffee, my phone counts those steps whereas before I had the watch, I&#x27;d often take my phone out and then forget it on my desk when I did those things.</p><p>The Google Authenticator app is <i>almost</i> useful on it, but it generally only works if I&#x27;ve recently opened it on my phone. I rarely have to use it more than once in day, so I just use my phone.</p><p>Weather is useful. Oh, I also use Stocard to manually enter loyalty numbers at a gas pump. I&#x27;ve never tried using in store.</p><p>It&#x27;s kind of neat for controlling Google Music whether I&#x27;m listening with bluetooth or casting to my living room stereo, but not something I use regularly nor would miss if it didn&#x27;t exist.</p><p>I don&#x27;t really use any other apps on it. I had to block quite a few notifications of random things -- it seems everyone thinks their app notifications are really important and should show up my on wrist.</p><p>People find it a combination of fascinating&#x2F;impressive&#x2F;weird that I can pull up a live HD view of my baby camera (via TinyCam connected to a Foscam HD IP camera). I don&#x27;t find that to be a useful feature so don&#x27;t do it other than when my wife asks me to show someone.</p><p>So I know there&#x27;s a lot of negativity here about &#x27;smart&#x27; watches, but overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with it and really have no big complaints. It&#x27;s got a couple handy functions vs a normal watch. It costs within the same ballpark as what I was going to spend on a watch anyway (I&#x27;m not a watch guy). It looks like a regular watch (a few times I&#x27;ve had someone see me activate it and say something to the effect of &quot;oh, it&#x27;s a smart watch!

This means that mirror writing requires 1) more muscle strain or 2) less muscle strain than writing with the dominant hand if either the hand is switched, or the direction (LTR or RTL).  If you swap both factors at the same time, then the strain is the same.</p><p>Left-handers who write LTR and switch direction (RTL) reduce the muscle strain compared to their usual writing as they&#x27;re now pulling the pen.  A right hander who does the same in this situation has to push the pen RTL with their right hand, which is harder than they&#x27;re used to.  A right hander should use the left-hand for mirror writing so they pull the pen like they&#x27;re used to.</p><p>From this information, you can derive why people think it&#x27;s easier to mirror write by switching hands, and others think it&#x27;s easier for left-handers than right-handers to mirror write with their original hand.</p><p>TL;DR: Yes, there is initial effort to start mirror writing.  But the real difference is that in the long-term, one group will find mirror writing to cause more hand strain than normal, and others will find it less hand strain than normal, because in one group pushing the pen is normal and in the other pulling it is.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13189237,"story_id":13187316,"children":[{"id":13192541,"created_at_i":1481887920,"type":"comment","author":"alfanick","text":"<p>You&#x27;ve actualy inspired me to try mirror writing - I am left-handed (though I can write smht with my right hand), well I found it easy, intuitive and natural.

Apollo came after Relay 1, and so has been designed with a few key differentiators: (1) flexibility, since it&#x27;s built in a modular way and has a lot of hooks into internals, (2) less opinions, because it works with any GraphQL server and doesn&#x27;t require a particular type of schema, and (3) optimized for devtools, since it doesn&#x27;t generate dynamic queries on the fly and is built on top of Redux. You can see the new dev tools we launched yesterday here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev-blog.apollodata.com&#x2F;apollo-client-developer-tools-ff89181ebcf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev-blog.apollodata.com&#x2F;apollo-client-developer-tool...</a></p><p>As for client&#x2F;server communication in the future, it seems there are two main camps right now:</p><p>1. Lossy APIs - this is if you use a REST API or GraphQL to send data to the client. The server knows a lot more than the client does, and the API returns only what the client needs to know at that moment. This has the advantage that it doesn&#x27;t impose any limitations on your backend schema or storage, so you can put a REST or GraphQL API on top of literally any backend.</p><p>2. Database replication, like Meteor or Realm. In this case, the client asks for objects and they are replicated to the server via some kind of push mechanism. In this case, the client has a much easier time predicting server operations and achieving consistency. On the other hand, the server has to be much smarter and this places a lot of restrictions on what kind of database you can use. For example, Meteor essentially requires MongoDB, Realm has its own database.</p><p>With Apollo we&#x27;re trying to build towards the best implementation of approach (1) because our main goal is to enable decoupling between the client and server.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13188564,"story_id":13187431,"children":[]},{"id":13189355,"created_at_i":1481841878,"type":"comment","author":"sorenbs","text":"<p>Sashkos answer below is pretty good.</p><p>To get a good understanding of the difference between Apollo and Relay I would suggest going through both <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learnrelay.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learnrelay.org&#x2F;</a> and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.learnapollo.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.learnapollo.com&#x2F;</a> - should be doable in a couple hours.</p><p>After that you could take a look at the Graphcool Console <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;graphcool&#x2F;console\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;graphcool&#x2F;console</a> It&#x27;s the most complex open source app build with Relay that I&#x27;m aware of.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13188564,"story_id":13187431,"children":[]}]}]},{"id":13188254,"created_at_i":1481834974,"type":"comment","author":"wwalser","text":"<p>I came to the comments to point out that I didn&#x27;t know what Apollo was.

It is immediately clear, in my opinion, that Graph.cool is a much better designed product in every aspect. Graph.cool&#x27;s UX exudes refinement and quality that Scaphold&#x27;s does not.</p><p>An example of this is the fact they invite you to their Slack team automatically when you sign up (i.e. use the email you sign up with to invite you, you don&#x27;t have to do anything). They really care about their customers, and the Slack community around Graph.cool is much more active than Scaphold&#x27;s. In fact, it&#x27;s mostly the community that is buzzing around on Slack, and it&#x27;s about people learning GraphQL, not necessarily learning how to use Graph.cool. The Graph.cool team seem to be really motivated to help everyone learn to use GraphQL, not just their service. This is also evident if you get in touch with the founders of Graph.cool - they are just nice people to talk to.</p><p>Any feature distinction that Scaphold may have over Graph.cool is quickly disappearing. I can only think of one, subscriptions, and Graph.cool has that on their roadmap to be released very shortly. On the other hand, Graph.cool has plenty of features that Scaphold does not, such as Auth0 integration, Relay AND Apollo support (from the same schema), a much better permission model.</p><p>Oh, and it&#x27;s free (for now) :)</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13188774,"story_id":13187431,"children":[{"id":13191254,"created_at_i":1481865567,"type":"comment","author":"bmpafa","text":"<p>This is incorrect on several points. Scaphold supports relay and Apollo out of the box and integrates with auth0 (per their docs; I&#x27;ve used neither feature).</p><p>Subjectively, having played with both, I chose scaphold (over graph.cool and reindex) for a few reasons:</p><p>- pricing model makes a lot more sense to me. Graph.cool tiers their pricing on user counts, which makes very little sense to me for a product the cost drivers of which are storage and throughput. They also apparently count a user once they register, with no clear way of handling inactive users (can&#x27;t be good for your LTV calcs). Reindex was also suboptimal imo, with steep jumps from free tier to paid. They also charge based on &#x27;operations,&#x27; which, while less so, also seems strangely divorced from what I imagine their cost drivers are. Scaphold seems to have taken firebase&#x27;s pricing model, which was a smart move</p><p>- storage. Graph.cool has really low storage per tier. Reindex bills storage separately from &#x27;operations&#x27; and only charges in $50 5GB chunks (5.1 GB last month? Sorry!). Scaphold again copies firebase&#x27;s pricing with small, inexpensive increments.</p><p>- ui. I didn&#x27;t use graph.cool&#x27;s ui too much, but I&#x27;m very happy with scaphold&#x27;s. Afaik reminded didn&#x27;t have any ui to speak of--someone correct me here if I&#x27;m wrong. You can build your entire schema in scaphold&#x27;s ui (with very helpful tool tips most of the time) , manage integrations (which, generally, just make certain queries&#x2F;mutations available), and view some pretty thorough analytics on your app. Coming from firebase, which has been really neglecting web app users in favor of mobile lately (imo), this was really nice.</p><p>Lastly, I&#x27;m new to graphql, but as I understand it, scaphold has added some nice features on top of the API. It seems to mirror PostgraphQL (a postgres &lt;-&gt; graphql utility), and adds pretty robust support for relationships (1:1,1:many,many:many). My schema is highly relational and, so far,  it&#x27;s a breeze.</p><p>I will note that graph.cool seems to have much more newbie-friendly docs, and maybe more comprehensive docs over all. Scaphold&#x27;s docs are okay: they&#x27;re wider than they are deep (maybe a paragraph for every feature  w&#x2F; an uncommented snippet), there are some obvious mistakes, and some parts of the docs are scattered between the docs page and the UI&#x27;s tool tips.

I&#x27;ve noticed some people use a clever communication and social trick I call &quot;word dropping&quot;. &quot;word dropping&quot; consists of forming sentences only in the intention to say or write a set of words because doing so can have an effect on some people. (Example of word set: de-risk, small market, big market, MVP, hire, key role, business plan, etc.) It is exactly like a text written with random words, it means absolutely nothing, but the trick is to do that with a limit set of words which when put together quasi-randomly provide a feeling of sense. One can see the disastrous consequences such a thing can have if people start believing into it. It&#x27;s super powerful because word dropping cost nothing to produce and cost a lot to dismiss with proper arguments. This only hurts terribly.</p><p>I&#x27;ve found some people use plenty of social intelligence hacks like that, which works, hurts and decrease productivity. How do you protect someone from that?

All of the online apps seem like slow knock-off products.</p><p>In particular, Excel Online feels like a joke compared to Google Spreadsheets. At first you notice the sluggish movement of focus from cell to cell due to this ridiculous animation. Then when you select a cell value from a drop-down and hit tab, focus moves down instead of to the right, which is infuriating when you suddenly find yourself typing in the wrong cell. Somehow they screwed up copy and paste as well, sometimes pasting takes multiple seconds. Then if you work on something else for a bit, the page gives you an error about inactivity and makes you reload in order to resume. The whole thing is so bad I do my work in Google Spreadsheets and then copy the finished work into Excel Online.</p><p>As a developer, one of my primary use-cases for spreadsheets is to generate and maintain an overview of different legacy implementations, the state of their rewrite, and any changes in behavior we&#x27;ve made. This type of work is largely done collaboratively with other devs and project leads. Turns out this type of real time collaboration for spreadsheets is basically dead with Office 365. It feels like we&#x27;re going backwards in time, I used to just share the document and others would make their changes, but now we&#x27;re fighting over file locks and in a few cases I&#x27;ve heard of people sending files back and forth with email.</p><p>Also, I really miss the &quot;Shared with me&quot; view in Google Drive. With OneDrive there is a separate drive for myself and for each group I&#x27;m a member of. When someone shares a file with one of my groups it doesn&#x27;t show up in my OneDrive, I have to look through each of the groups&#x27; OneDrive.</p><p>Oh, and the online scheduling assistant is useless when you invite a group of people. The whole group shows up as one &quot;person&quot; who is busy as soon as anyone is busy. Also, noone can see the RSVP status except for the organizer, so when our scrum master is home sick I have no idea who has accepted the meeting.

I also have been diagnosed with dysgraphia.</p><p>I think the effects of dysgraphia are much more akin to losing a limb than ADHD, but taking medication is honestly one of the most life-changing experiences of my life. I tried medication way back when, and the side effects were horrible. I didn&#x27;t try them again until I was having trouble at work, and I visited a psych for a doctors note requesting some mild accommodations related to my dysgraphia. I had avoided medication because until that point I was sure I could do anything else anyone else could, and I was afraid it would fundamentally change who I was.</p><p>That fear was largely unfounded. Some medications give me side effects, and some make me feel like I&#x27;m not myself. Eventually I found the right medication and dosage. After about a month on that medication, I looked at what I had accomplished and I was so overwhelmed with emotion I honestly cried. I had been making life so unnecessarily hard for myself, and I had been so hard on myself. Like, I cannot believe how much easier everything is. I feel like I used to get everywhere by running in molasses, and then someone told me about highways and cars.</p><p>The thing about medications is that they don&#x27;t turn your life around for you. They basically give you the power to control your life.</p><p>Maybe there isn&#x27;t a medication out there for you. Honestly, a huge part for me was finding the right doctor. He is one the few docs I&#x27;ve ever met who specializes in adult ADHD, and he&#x27;s really fucking sharp. I don&#x27;t actually like our meetings very much, cause he&#x27;s not much of a conversationalist and is pretty gruff, but he knows his shit. He&#x27;s willing to write prescriptions that most doctors won&#x27;t write because the dosages are too abuseable or whatever. (And his other specialty is addiction, so he definitely has a view on that).</p><p>For instance, I tried Ritalin, and I hated it. I just felt angry the entire day I was on it. I was suddenly aware that I should be concentrate, but I couldn&#x27;t concentrate at all. Instead of spending several months titrating me up on Adderall, he just gave me a pretty high dose, since my reaction basically indicated my ADHD wasn&#x27;t going to respond to lower levels. Adderall helped, but the side effects were miserable. I felt like I wasn&#x27;t myself using it, almost like a zombie. I felt like I couldn&#x27;t change gears at all.</p><p>Anyways, long story short, I found Evekeo actually worked best for me. Adderall is 25% levoamphetamines, and 75% dextroamphetamines. Evekeo is 50&#x2F;50 levo&#x2F;dextro. My basic understanding is that Levoamphetamines affect the rest of the body, whereas dextroamphetamines mostly affect the head. For this reason, the DEA has typically felt that l-amp has less clinical value and is more abusable, but the difference between Evekeo and Adderall is night and day for me. I actually feel like myself. Now, I have never taken cocaine, so I can&#x27;t tell you how it compares, but if you feel like adderall takes away your ability to do all of those things you listed as benefits, I&#x27;d say that Evekeo is worth a shot.</p><p>I can relate to wanting to truck it out though. After my second consultation, my doctor said he was amazed by all the achievements I have in my life, given the degree to which I am ADHD. His assessment was that I must be one of the most overwhelmingly stubborn people on the face of the planet. I never have thought as myself as a stubborn person, but my family and closest friends would definitely agree with that statement. I think that stubbornness is what prevented me from seeking help earlier, but also what motivated me to keep going.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13187661,"story_id":13186201,"children":[{"id":13194456,"created_at_i":1481906357,"type":"comment","author":"soylentcola","text":"<p>From what I&#x27;ve gathered over the years, dextro-amp is primarily responsible for focus, attention, and (potentially) euphoria while levo-amp is primarily responsible for peripheral effects like anxiety, jitters, and other &quot;body-centric&quot; things.</p><p>As a result, I&#x27;ve always understood d-amp to be considered more abusable and part of the reason for the mix in Adderall and generic equivalents (although it&#x27;s also allegedly a better mix for treating most ADD&#x2F;ADHD).</p><p>It&#x27;s why you can get Adderall if you&#x27;re diagnosed with these disorders but it&#x27;s rare to see anyone prescribe Dexedrine (which is just d-amp).

I was working as a baker, starting work at 630am four days a week. She was up before I was, and usually going to bed later than I was, just trying to get enough time to finish everything.</p><p>On a rare occasion that she took a break and went out to get dinner with some friends, she got in a car accident and totaled her car. She was too stressed out to focus, she was so worried about the work she had left to do, she didn&#x27;t notice an oncoming truck and the front half of the Maxima she was driving got ripped off. She was essentially barely functional from lack of sleep, and she just didn&#x27;t have the time to catch up.

The overhead associated with the unused element is sizeof(T) &#x2F; (sizeof(T) * n + sizeof(RingBuffer) + malloc_overhead), where T is likely to be at most the size of a pointer on the platform.  If we assume a standard x86-64 platform with a sizeof(T) to be 8, we can eyeball the struct and guess that GCC will probably spit out a 24 byte structure since it&#x27;s going to want 8-byte alignment on the T* after the uint32 values.  On top of that, not counting malloc overhead, the array will take up n * sizeof(T) bytes.  For regular malloc, the overhead on an 8 byte allocation is going to be an extra 12 bytes (according to malloc.c).  Assuming we are allocating our ring buffer on the stack, this brings our total size up to 48 bytes for the &quot;correct&quot; ring buffer vs 56 bytes for the &quot;wrong&quot; ring buffer.  Actual savings will be at most 14% and go to 0% as the size of the buffer goes to infinity, proportional to 1 &#x2F; n, which is less than what one might assume.  Consequently, this means that for any buffer over length 2, the power of two buffer size requirement will likely waste more memory than it saves since we are saving at most 8 bytes, but losing the difference between a power of two and the desired queue size, so odds are it makes more sense to write a 1 or 2 element ring buffer as a special case than to use this implementation for all ring buffers.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13186232,"story_id":13186232,"children":[{"id":13190391,"created_at_i":1481852332,"type":"comment","author":"NotThe1Pct","text":"<p>Quite frankly I wrote this more like an exercise.

Of course, this can differ wildly from box to box so take that into account as well.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Does the number of cores affect general performance or only helps in multitasking and data science</p><p>More cores means more data can be processed at the same time. For a gamer, even if you have 20 cores, it doesn&#x27;t help you because they&#x27;re after <i>speed</i>. For myself, it&#x27;s being able to run several Adobe products doing video editing, photo editing, and graphic design, on all the same machine, at the same time. Think of it as workload vs. speed. Workstations are more <i>powerful</i> and built for heavy workloads, whereas gaming PC&#x27;s are mainly built for <i>speed</i>.</p><p>And yes, the main application is in crunching big data sets, CAD design, or anything heavy on the graphical side of things. I definitely saw a big swing in stability when I switched to a workstation with the myriad of Adobe products I use.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Is ECC memory worth it (in practice, not in theory)</p><p>So in theory this is the advantage of ECC:</p><p><i>ECC (which stands for Error Correction Code) RAM is very popular in servers or other systems with high-value data as it protects against data corruption by automatically detecting and correcting memory errors. Standard RAM uses banks of eight memory chips in which data is stored and provided to the CPU on demand. ECC RAM is different as it has an additional memory chip which acts as both error detection and correction for the other eight RAM chips.</i></p><p>In practice, I can say it for sure helps your system to be a lot more reliable and stable. I&#x27;ve been running my workstation for several years without a power cycle and its been rock solid, no issues, no hiccups, no nothing. As such, this is the main advantage of workstations is their reliability. I also like the idea in some models of stuffing up to 128GB of RAM or running dual video cards.</p><p>In the end, with so many people opting for laptops and gaming systems, you can get your hands on a hell of a workforce PC for under $500. The processors and video card are still dirt cheap (around $100). The only mildly expensive stuff is the RAM. I&#x27;ve really good luck with the HP workstations, but that&#x27;s just me. I&#x27;d say dig around and see what you can find.

Christian and Jewish philosophy, and for that matter Muslim philosophy are all very different. As such, there are different interpretations of the same input data one could say. The problem is not even the input data is the same. (btw: the term Judaeo-Christian suggesting commonalities IMO is wrong and might as well not exist because it&#x27;s lumping mostly different things together).</p><p>The Old Testament is a Christian edited version of various selections of Torah, namely 5 books, but even the divisions differ between Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestants. Beyond potentially reorganizing and excluding content, another disconnect is that the Torah according to most Jewish traditions is both a written and oral tradition. Most Jews who are knowledgable about theology would agree that Judaism is not explained, nor summed up, or even represented by the Old Testament, let alone the Torah itself. Further, oral traditions as well as cultural and religious duality are so important, that you can&#x27;t actually read things like the Torah without knowing them. Philosophically, there&#x27;s a pretty large difference between Judaism and Christianity on so many levels related to spiritual significance and directions of text.</p><p>Even inside Judaism there are huge divisions. Note that there are people who devote their lives to studying Torah and while I have a few interesting things to say about that (depending on the context, not nice things), I acknowledge it as intellectually interesting in that you have many people with different interpretations, including seeing the text itself as liquid or even adaptable (ex: to modern times). This kind of studying, questioning, and analysis is encouraged in Judaism. While it happens as well in modern Christianity, the views and treatment of text here are very different suffice to say without going into great detail.</p><p>Another large issue is translation. Ancient Hebrew is just that, ancient and not completely understood with 100% accuracy even among native modern Hebrew speakers and scholars. Even Aramaic and other languages of related texts have changed. Pronoun translation alone from a gendered language like Hebrew to English is bad enough for example, but factor in that often the path could be as muddled as Ancient Hebrew -&gt; Greek -&gt; Latin -&gt; &lt;Your Language, ex: English&gt;. There are of course more modern direct attempts, but quite often translations are not from the source, but rather translations of translations. Between translation, time, and oral traditions, there&#x27;s a lot of signal decay.</p><p>As for other things about Judaism related to the Old Testament, the mention of it being 2.0 splits a lot here. Judaism has all kinds of commentary, supplementary texts, additional scrolls, and other books that are various degrees of &quot;holy&quot; or even &quot;canon.&quot; Pretty much none of these exist in Christianity and only a few play any role or influence on the New Testament (aside: New Testament also morphed over time and had translation issues and so on). To make matters more interesting, some interpretations become part of oral law and even influence the readings themselves. Indeed, words are often changed or substituted by some people, while others would rather die than do anything but what they perceive as read things in their original form. If you purchase a book even that contains the Torah and what the Old Testament is based on, each version will have wildly different commentary, and sometimes even omissions.</p><p>I could go on, but since it&#x27;s HN, let me just summarize a few things about the Old Testament in computer terms to get back to the point:</p><p>- Christianity vs. Judaism is not like a Git branch, but rather taking a few conceptual things and writing different implementations. There is little if any shared code, but maybe you could think of it as people who worked on an old project together and then had a split and built new things.</p><p>- New Testament is not v 2.0 but more of a re-implementation with what could argue is some code refactoring and slapping on a new interface (some things in common at a high level, but not at a lower level). Some (a lot) features are missing in the re-implementation.</p><p>- New Testament is heavy on marketing Jesus and his disciples, while ironically this would be an offense punishable by death by Old Testament and the Torah (you are not allowed to call yourself or be called the Messiah, the conditions for the Messiah are specifically laid out and according to these texts have not happened). New Testament would fail build tests and constraint checks.</p><p>-  Christianity and Judaism have different licenses, plug-ins, benevolent overlords, and so on...</p><p>- The human compiler pretty much is broken because people aren&#x27;t following the source of either most of the time, probably thankfully. I know the goats, sheep, etc. are probably happy aboutr that, let alone humans.</p><p>Well I am sure someone is going to hate me now or kill me for sacrilege.

Similar interpretations could be made of Christian scriptures (and indeed, the Book of Joshua thoroughly documents many occasions when Israel raided cities, including occasions wherein they were instructed to kill any living person -- man, woman, or child -- that inhabited it). Nothing Jesus taught would preclude such actions by Christians today. Jesus even said that he came not to send peace, but a sword.</p><p>The important thing here is not to pretend a) that Christians are fundamentally invulnerable to the same interpretations or impulses, because we know from history that they are not; and b) that Islam is an existential threat in total based on the malicious practices or interpretations of some of its prominent sects, because we also know from history that it is not.</p><p>To the extent that it exists, the Muslim world&#x27;s conflict with the West is based <i>not</i> on intractable doctrinal conflicts, but social and political changes that occurred in both regions&#x2F;cultures over the course of the 20th century.

There&#x27;s actually a lot of interesting political events that have gone into the current climate. It can&#x27;t be boiled down to the simplistic and obviously false conclusion that &quot;Islam and Christianity can&#x27;t co-exist&quot;, as a) they&#x27;re derived from the same traditions, such that their holy books recount many of the same narratives with only minor variations; and b) they&#x27;ve successfully co-existed for 1400 years, the overwhelming majority of which were not spent in conflict, and many of which were spent in cooperation and trade.</p><p>Please do not fall victim to the people trying to bait people of differing religious backgrounds against each other.
