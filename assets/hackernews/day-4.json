The encoding process is just as, if not more important than, the review process.

Doing &quot;learning&quot; in an all of one thing, then all of another, is less helpful than mixing up topics.  Baseball players that practice hitting 20 fastballs, then 20 sliders, etc. do less well OVERALL than one where the pitcher randomly picks a type of pitch one after another.</p><p>* Learn in different ways, or using different answers.  If you&#x27;re learning to sight read music, read the measures backwards.  Or down one side and up the other.   When you&#x27;re memorizing words, come up with a different sentence to use the word in, each time.  Come up with a word that rhymes with the correct word.  Describe a picture that would characterize the word&#x2F;concept.   Sing the word in a song.</p><p>* Synthesize, synthesize, synthesize.  (overlapping the previous point) - when coming up with an answer to a question, consider different questions that have the same answer.  What things are LIKE this answer?  What things are different?  Picture yourself using this word&#x2F;concept in some setting.  (Things I like to do are picturing myself in my house.  Or outside.  Or in the winter, or naked, or with a famous person (perhaps also naked).)  The point is to create imagery associated with the thing you&#x27;re learning.</p><p>A lot of this boils down to getting at the memory through many different neural pathways.  SRS is just a way to strengthen ONE of those ways, which is important, but ideally you want to use many.  One strong rope holding you from falling down a cliff is good.

Most things we choose to learn about, we have no good plan to weave them into regular life, and so not a long term strong desire to learn about them, and so not that much motivation to stick past the novelty stage.</p><p>[1] speculative.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13153010,"story_id":13151790,"children":[]},{"id":13153376,"created_at_i":1481491599,"type":"comment","author":"summarite","text":"<p>&gt; My main problem with spaced repetition programs like Anki is getting the motivation to stick with them long-term.

As one that has to memorize insane quantities of information in a limited amount of time, I&#x27;ll offer some thoughts on my experiences with various memorization strategies mentioned (or not mentioned) in the article.</p><p>1. Understanding the &quot;big picture.&quot; The idea is, if you understand the mechanism underlying X, you can reason out Y. This works great for physiology-type where things work in predictable ways. Do I need to memorize pulmonary function test results? No. Because I can reason my way through the consequences of different pulmonary diseases. However, this simply does not work for things like anatomy or pharmacology where there are thousands of names of things to memorize (many of which don&#x27;t provide any clue in the name itself). Yesterday I heard from a friend that worked in a related industry that pharm companies typically pick from a list of randomly generated syllables to choose a name for the generic of their drug. There is incentive to pick an unsavory, unmemorable amalgam of syllables to discourage people from buying the name brand once their patent runs out.</p><p>2. Acronyms are sometimes helpful but mostly overused. There are acronyms for literally everything in medicine, to the point where each new acronym runs the risk of being noise. The most helpful ones usually have to do with ascribing the order to things. &quot;Some lovers try positions that they can&#x27;t handle&quot; for wrist bones or &quot;Oh, Oh, Oh, to, touch and feel very good velvet AH&quot; for the order of cranial nerves. A great example of a worthless acronym is the TORCH infections, which stands for &quot;Toxoplasmosis, Other, Rubella, CMV, and HSV.&quot;  That &quot;Other&quot; stands for the following: Coxsackievirus, VSV, Chlamydia, HIV, HTLV, Syphilis, Zika. Super helpful... :P</p><p>3. Method of loci. My first block of medical school, some two weeks before exams, I bought that oft-touted &quot;Moonwalking with Einstein&quot; book. It was a bit of an act of desperation. I had previously heard the author speak at Railsconf and figured I&#x27;d give the whole memory palace a try. I read the book (well, the pertinent parts) and spent a couple days figuring out how to encode chemical names into a person-action-object system. Then I translated the steps of carbohydrate metabolism into a walk around my college campus. Results? It worked! However, it took WAY too long. I could&#x27;ve done the same thing in less time by simply drawing the steps out on a sheet of paper over and over again.</p><p>4. The testing effect. Way back in high school, my AP psychology professor gave us reading quizzes before every class based on the studies that showed testing improved recall more than homework assignments. To this day, I remember more from that class than any other class I&#x27;ve taken, even those in college. I wish more professors used this strategy, but it takes more time and prep on their end. My particular medical program only tests at the end of each block in the form giant (8-hour) cumulative exams. On one hand, it&#x27;s nice to not have to worry about balancing midterms or tests from multiple classes the middle of our eight week blocks. On the other hand, there is no way to benefit from the testing effect.</p><p>5. Spaced repetition. I agree with much of what the author has to say about spaced repetition. Yes, it works. But there are two large issues with it. The first one is having the discipline to regularly rehearse the information. Pounding flashcards everyday gets monotonous (and sometimes discouraging). The author argues that spaced repetition prevents you from having to review too much at a time. But that depends on you keeping a pretty strict schedule. Miss a day, and you have double the cards to look at. Miss a couple of days and the amount of cards you have to drill to catch up becomes psychologically prohibitive.</p><p>The second issue is that flash card creation is the absolute rate limiting step. Every flash card program that I&#x27;ve looked into (Anki, Quizlet, among others) has a terrible UI. Frustrated by this, I actually spent ~100 or so hours of my first med school block developing my own SRS program. Even with some improvements made to the interface, flash card entry was still too slow, to the point that I stopped using after that first block. A year later, I dusted off my program and I added a feature that allows me to import questions from Workflowy notes taken during lectures. This proved invaluable in studying for my most recent exams (currently using it now). I can keep question-like notes in a readable format on Workflowy, then do a massive import to build my cards.</p><p>Another minor issue is that there is no way to value one fact over another. There should be a way to mark something as high-yield so that it appears more often. Sometimes I am faced with a decision of, &quot;Well, I am running out of time... I can drill these cards, or I can open my notes and try to pick out the highest yeild information.&quot;</p><p>I have a lot of thoughts about improving upon these prohibitive issues with SRS. I&#x27;m hoping to roll out a more comprehensive solution next year when I have more time to code.</p><p>FWIW here&#x27;s a screenshot of my current software: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;sVTlMvP.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;sVTlMvP.png</a></p>","points":null,"parent_id":13151790,"story_id":13151790,"children":[{"id":13156921,"created_at_i":1481536508,"type":"comment","author":"laichzeit0","text":"<p>&gt;The second issue is that flash card creation is the absolute rate limiting step.</p><p>Supermemo has a very simple Q&amp;A text format that you can import.

Certainly, learning in context has advantageous for improving grammar and in some situations verb usage - therefore a more balanced approach.

In essence, it is an information processing system - given that we surpassed the range of 400-or-so people societies where everybody knows everybody else, how can the individual get enough information so that she can function to serve the society? In the case of western societies this means for example being able to vote, or get voted for. \nAn ill-informed, egotistical individual might become a danger for society as a whole, like we are seeing in current US politics and the discussion about the &quot;post factual&quot; society. The term itself hints towards a failure of the media system. And to that end, the filter bubbles of social networkd have a huge responsibility in it. Being informed means that one has to be confronted with inconvenient truths and become part of the quest to resolve them through argument and reason. Given that we now have unprecedented means to filter out diverging opinions, we as technologists have a new responsibility for this that we are not living up to. It might have to take a catastrophe first to hand off the power of making decisions here - eg new policies - that force social media companies to optimize for other metrics than just &quot;engagement&quot; to live up to this responsibility.

News packaging influences the timing, content and perception of government initiatives. News frenzies make a superstition out of scientific and medical research.

And if there\nreally is a big story, say,\na nuke exploded somewhere, then\nI will want to know and\nlikely that will be in the headlines.\nAlso I get some\nlessons by example in, say, PR nonsense\nfrom some experts in getting \nattention from even usually next to\nnothing in meaningful content!  Like in the remark about \nwriting news stories of the reporter in the\noriginal version of the movie\n<i>The Thing,</i> if the real story\nis not good, then he &quot;will make it\ngood&quot;.  So, the news distorting\nthe truth is an old story.  I also learn about &quot;the\ncommon man in the street&quot; --\nfrom the fact that millions of\npeople  watch that stuff --\nmaybe the most important thing\ncan learn from watching the news\nis about people\nfrom the fact that each day hundreds\nof millions of people pay attention\nto that stuff!</p><p>(ii) Any article written by a \nreporter or news organization,\ne.g., AP, I nearly always refuse\nto take seriously or even read\nat all anymore.  From my huge\nsample of such articles I did\nread in the past, I assume \nthat such an article fails\neven common high school term\npaper writing standards for\nmeaningful, trustworthy content\nand that it is likely\nsome or all of\nuninformed, misinformed,\nbiased, and deliberately \ndistorted, fabricated, or\nlying.  I say that such articles\nare (borrowing from the\nBogart movie <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>),\nwith bitter contempt, \nby <i>newsies</i> and nearly always\nrefuse to read them or, if read them\nfor some special reason,\nflatly refuse to take the\ncontent at face value.</p><p>(iii) I am eager to pay attention\nto news stories on topics\nI&#x27;m interested in and signed\nby people with high credibility.  \nMostly for such an article,\nI keep a copy on my computer\nwith a reference to the source\nand with an abstract and an\nentry in an index.</p><p>I believe that staying &quot;informed&quot;\nis important:  E.g., here in the\nUS we just had an election\nfor POTUS.  IMHO, the two main\ncandidates were very different\nand promised significantly\ndifferent, better&#x2F;worse, results for the US\nand even my own life.</p><p>So, first,\nI tried to say informed and, to\nsome extent, more superficial\nthan I would like, did.\nAnd by watching the campaigns,\nthe candidates, and the reactions\nof the newsies and citizens, I\ndid get some education\nin such things -- I got some\nmore insight into people, \npersonalities, politics, e.g.,\nstuff I didn&#x27;t learn much\nabout studying mathematics!</p><p>And, second, I got <i>involved</i>\nby practicing my writing and\nposting on-line --\nso, I tried to do better as\na US citizen.</p><p>So, sure, now I get essentially\nall my <i>news</i> from the Internet.\nOne important approach is to\nuse HN as a <i>filter</i> to find more important\ncontent.</p><p>Here at HN, often there are \nreferences to articles \nat the NYT.  Unless such \narticles appear to be\nsigned by people\nwith credibility and\nindependent of the NYT,\nI flatly, automatically refuse\nto read them.  I have,\nmaybe with one exception\na decade, \nzip, zilch, and zero respect\nfor anything the NYT\nthinks or believes.</p><p>The Internet permits a <i>news\norganization</i>, maybe\njust some one person,\nto reach nearly everyone\nwho might be interested\nin content from that person.\nFrom that fact,\nI am guessing that the Internet --\nthat does permit <i>deeper</i>\npresentations of information --\nis the key to an\nirresistible, radical\ntransformation of public\nunderstanding\nand effectiveness in\nthe US democracy.</p><p>So, net, with some nuance, \nI disagree with some of the OP\nand conclude that \nthe <i>news</i> and staying informed,\nare important.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13153539,"story_id":13153539,"children":[{"id":13156474,"created_at_i":1481530362,"type":"comment","author":"p10_user","text":"<p>Is there a reason you decided to single out the NYT at the end of your post?

Anger a reader, e.g., can anger some readers by misleading them, and they can be gone in a single click.</p><p>&gt; I like your idea of archiving and summarizing articles you find interesting and meaningful.</p><p>For me, the keys are: (1) Good exploitation of the hierarchical file system on my computer, HPFS on Windows.  (2) A good text editor that has a powerful macro language (KEdit).  (3) A dirt simple way to jump to (go to)  the more heavily used parts of the hierarchical file system tree -- a command line macro G &lt;token&gt; where there is an environment variable of the form &lt;token&gt;.MARK (set from a file a maintain with my editor when a console window opens) with value the tree name of the a particular heavily used part of the tree.  E.g., I can type</p><p>G ASP</p><p>thus make <i>current</i> a \nfile system directory with\nsuch information on \nsome hundreds of references on\nMicrosoft&#x27;s ASP.NET software\nfor building Web pages.  For the\nsoftware for my startup, I have\nnow well over 5000 articles of\ntechnical documentation, and I\ncan find and get to each one\nquickly.  Indeed, commonly\nmy source code comments\nhave my file system tree names\nof relevant documentation,\nand one keystroke in my editor\ninvokes a macro that \ndisplays the documentation.\nRight, the editor macro reads\nand\nparses\nthe line with the tree name, keeps\nthe tree name, and discards\nthe comment delimiters, right,\nwith the comment delimiter\ntokens determined from the\nfile type.</p><p>Then some more command line scripts\nand editor macros make it easy to\ngrab and save content and\nabstract and index it.</p><p>There is one more in a sense above all the rest:  I have a little command line script  FACTS\nthat basically just uses the editor\nto open a file FACTS.DAT (the \nscript does check to see if the file\nis already open and, if so, \ndoes not open it again and instead\n<i>un-hides</i> it and\nraises it to the top of the Z-order).\nThen this file has little notes, often\nas short as a Tweet.  Each note has, right, some key words.  \nUsually there\nare links as Internet URLs or local\nfile system tree names.\nSo, there are phone numbers,\ne-mail addresses, user IDs,\npasswords, street addresses,\nopen hours of businesses,\njust things I want to remember, \netc.</p><p>What is astounding is (1) how\nuseful it is and (2) how few bytes\nit has.  So, since 9&#x2F;2&#x2F;2005, the file has\n2,128,672 bytes and 3811 entries, e.g., an average of about one entry a day.  It is shocking what an effective memory aid that little thing is and even\nsuggests that maybe real AI\nwill need much less memory than\none might guess.  So, right, I have\na few, simple editor macros to help\nme use that file, and with only the  2,128,672 bytes the simplest, least\nefficient text search and select works fine.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13156474,"story_id":13153539,"children":[]}]}]},{"id":13156823,"created_at_i":1481535170,"type":"comment","author":"DanielBMarkham","text":"<p>Nice thesis, especially since I agree with it :)</p><p>A few other things the author failed to note.</p><p>1.

While I get it&#x27;s attractive to target the gaming market because it&#x27;s profitable in the present, it probably means death in the future.
