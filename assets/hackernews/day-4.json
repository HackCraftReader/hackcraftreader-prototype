The encoding process is just as, if not more important than, the review process.

Doing &quot;learning&quot; in an all of one thing, then all of another, is less helpful than mixing up topics.  Baseball players that practice hitting 20 fastballs, then 20 sliders, etc. do less well OVERALL than one where the pitcher randomly picks a type of pitch one after another.</p><p>* Learn in different ways, or using different answers.  If you&#x27;re learning to sight read music, read the measures backwards.  Or down one side and up the other.   When you&#x27;re memorizing words, come up with a different sentence to use the word in, each time.  Come up with a word that rhymes with the correct word.  Describe a picture that would characterize the word&#x2F;concept.   Sing the word in a song.</p><p>* Synthesize, synthesize, synthesize.  (overlapping the previous point) - when coming up with an answer to a question, consider different questions that have the same answer.  What things are LIKE this answer?  What things are different?  Picture yourself using this word&#x2F;concept in some setting.  (Things I like to do are picturing myself in my house.  Or outside.  Or in the winter, or naked, or with a famous person (perhaps also naked).)  The point is to create imagery associated with the thing you&#x27;re learning.</p><p>A lot of this boils down to getting at the memory through many different neural pathways.  SRS is just a way to strengthen ONE of those ways, which is important, but ideally you want to use many.  One strong rope holding you from falling down a cliff is good.

Most things we choose to learn about, we have no good plan to weave them into regular life, and so not a long term strong desire to learn about them, and so not that much motivation to stick past the novelty stage.</p><p>[1] speculative.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13153010,"story_id":13151790,"children":[]},{"id":13153376,"created_at_i":1481491599,"type":"comment","author":"summarite","text":"<p>&gt; My main problem with spaced repetition programs like Anki is getting the motivation to stick with them long-term.

As one that has to memorize insane quantities of information in a limited amount of time, I&#x27;ll offer some thoughts on my experiences with various memorization strategies mentioned (or not mentioned) in the article.</p><p>1. Understanding the &quot;big picture.&quot; The idea is, if you understand the mechanism underlying X, you can reason out Y. This works great for physiology-type where things work in predictable ways. Do I need to memorize pulmonary function test results? No. Because I can reason my way through the consequences of different pulmonary diseases. However, this simply does not work for things like anatomy or pharmacology where there are thousands of names of things to memorize (many of which don&#x27;t provide any clue in the name itself). Yesterday I heard from a friend that worked in a related industry that pharm companies typically pick from a list of randomly generated syllables to choose a name for the generic of their drug. There is incentive to pick an unsavory, unmemorable amalgam of syllables to discourage people from buying the name brand once their patent runs out.</p><p>2. Acronyms are sometimes helpful but mostly overused. There are acronyms for literally everything in medicine, to the point where each new acronym runs the risk of being noise. The most helpful ones usually have to do with ascribing the order to things. &quot;Some lovers try positions that they can&#x27;t handle&quot; for wrist bones or &quot;Oh, Oh, Oh, to, touch and feel very good velvet AH&quot; for the order of cranial nerves. A great example of a worthless acronym is the TORCH infections, which stands for &quot;Toxoplasmosis, Other, Rubella, CMV, and HSV.&quot;  That &quot;Other&quot; stands for the following: Coxsackievirus, VSV, Chlamydia, HIV, HTLV, Syphilis, Zika. Super helpful... :P</p><p>3. Method of loci. My first block of medical school, some two weeks before exams, I bought that oft-touted &quot;Moonwalking with Einstein&quot; book. It was a bit of an act of desperation. I had previously heard the author speak at Railsconf and figured I&#x27;d give the whole memory palace a try. I read the book (well, the pertinent parts) and spent a couple days figuring out how to encode chemical names into a person-action-object system. Then I translated the steps of carbohydrate metabolism into a walk around my college campus. Results? It worked! However, it took WAY too long. I could&#x27;ve done the same thing in less time by simply drawing the steps out on a sheet of paper over and over again.</p><p>4. The testing effect. Way back in high school, my AP psychology professor gave us reading quizzes before every class based on the studies that showed testing improved recall more than homework assignments. To this day, I remember more from that class than any other class I&#x27;ve taken, even those in college. I wish more professors used this strategy, but it takes more time and prep on their end. My particular medical program only tests at the end of each block in the form giant (8-hour) cumulative exams. On one hand, it&#x27;s nice to not have to worry about balancing midterms or tests from multiple classes the middle of our eight week blocks. On the other hand, there is no way to benefit from the testing effect.</p><p>5. Spaced repetition. I agree with much of what the author has to say about spaced repetition. Yes, it works. But there are two large issues with it. The first one is having the discipline to regularly rehearse the information. Pounding flashcards everyday gets monotonous (and sometimes discouraging). The author argues that spaced repetition prevents you from having to review too much at a time. But that depends on you keeping a pretty strict schedule. Miss a day, and you have double the cards to look at. Miss a couple of days and the amount of cards you have to drill to catch up becomes psychologically prohibitive.</p><p>The second issue is that flash card creation is the absolute rate limiting step. Every flash card program that I&#x27;ve looked into (Anki, Quizlet, among others) has a terrible UI. Frustrated by this, I actually spent ~100 or so hours of my first med school block developing my own SRS program. Even with some improvements made to the interface, flash card entry was still too slow, to the point that I stopped using after that first block. A year later, I dusted off my program and I added a feature that allows me to import questions from Workflowy notes taken during lectures. This proved invaluable in studying for my most recent exams (currently using it now). I can keep question-like notes in a readable format on Workflowy, then do a massive import to build my cards.</p><p>Another minor issue is that there is no way to value one fact over another. There should be a way to mark something as high-yield so that it appears more often. Sometimes I am faced with a decision of, &quot;Well, I am running out of time... I can drill these cards, or I can open my notes and try to pick out the highest yeild information.&quot;</p><p>I have a lot of thoughts about improving upon these prohibitive issues with SRS. I&#x27;m hoping to roll out a more comprehensive solution next year when I have more time to code.</p><p>FWIW here&#x27;s a screenshot of my current software: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;sVTlMvP.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;sVTlMvP.png</a></p>","points":null,"parent_id":13151790,"story_id":13151790,"children":[{"id":13156921,"created_at_i":1481536508,"type":"comment","author":"laichzeit0","text":"<p>&gt;The second issue is that flash card creation is the absolute rate limiting step.</p><p>Supermemo has a very simple Q&amp;A text format that you can import.

Certainly, learning in context has advantageous for improving grammar and in some situations verb usage - therefore a more balanced approach.

In essence, it is an information processing system - given that we surpassed the range of 400-or-so people societies where everybody knows everybody else, how can the individual get enough information so that she can function to serve the society? In the case of western societies this means for example being able to vote, or get voted for. \nAn ill-informed, egotistical individual might become a danger for society as a whole, like we are seeing in current US politics and the discussion about the &quot;post factual&quot; society. The term itself hints towards a failure of the media system. And to that end, the filter bubbles of social networkd have a huge responsibility in it. Being informed means that one has to be confronted with inconvenient truths and become part of the quest to resolve them through argument and reason. Given that we now have unprecedented means to filter out diverging opinions, we as technologists have a new responsibility for this that we are not living up to. It might have to take a catastrophe first to hand off the power of making decisions here - eg new policies - that force social media companies to optimize for other metrics than just &quot;engagement&quot; to live up to this responsibility.

News packaging influences the timing, content and perception of government initiatives. News frenzies make a superstition out of scientific and medical research.

And if there\nreally is a big story, say,\na nuke exploded somewhere, then\nI will want to know and\nlikely that will be in the headlines.\nAlso I get some\nlessons by example in, say, PR nonsense\nfrom some experts in getting \nattention from even usually next to\nnothing in meaningful content!  Like in the remark about \nwriting news stories of the reporter in the\noriginal version of the movie\n<i>The Thing,</i> if the real story\nis not good, then he &quot;will make it\ngood&quot;.  So, the news distorting\nthe truth is an old story.  I also learn about &quot;the\ncommon man in the street&quot; --\nfrom the fact that millions of\npeople  watch that stuff --\nmaybe the most important thing\ncan learn from watching the news\nis about people\nfrom the fact that each day hundreds\nof millions of people pay attention\nto that stuff!</p><p>(ii) Any article written by a \nreporter or news organization,\ne.g., AP, I nearly always refuse\nto take seriously or even read\nat all anymore.  From my huge\nsample of such articles I did\nread in the past, I assume \nthat such an article fails\neven common high school term\npaper writing standards for\nmeaningful, trustworthy content\nand that it is likely\nsome or all of\nuninformed, misinformed,\nbiased, and deliberately \ndistorted, fabricated, or\nlying.  I say that such articles\nare (borrowing from the\nBogart movie <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>),\nwith bitter contempt, \nby <i>newsies</i> and nearly always\nrefuse to read them or, if read them\nfor some special reason,\nflatly refuse to take the\ncontent at face value.</p><p>(iii) I am eager to pay attention\nto news stories on topics\nI&#x27;m interested in and signed\nby people with high credibility.  \nMostly for such an article,\nI keep a copy on my computer\nwith a reference to the source\nand with an abstract and an\nentry in an index.</p><p>I believe that staying &quot;informed&quot;\nis important:  E.g., here in the\nUS we just had an election\nfor POTUS.  IMHO, the two main\ncandidates were very different\nand promised significantly\ndifferent, better&#x2F;worse, results for the US\nand even my own life.</p><p>So, first,\nI tried to say informed and, to\nsome extent, more superficial\nthan I would like, did.\nAnd by watching the campaigns,\nthe candidates, and the reactions\nof the newsies and citizens, I\ndid get some education\nin such things -- I got some\nmore insight into people, \npersonalities, politics, e.g.,\nstuff I didn&#x27;t learn much\nabout studying mathematics!</p><p>And, second, I got <i>involved</i>\nby practicing my writing and\nposting on-line --\nso, I tried to do better as\na US citizen.</p><p>So, sure, now I get essentially\nall my <i>news</i> from the Internet.\nOne important approach is to\nuse HN as a <i>filter</i> to find more important\ncontent.</p><p>Here at HN, often there are \nreferences to articles \nat the NYT.  Unless such \narticles appear to be\nsigned by people\nwith credibility and\nindependent of the NYT,\nI flatly, automatically refuse\nto read them.  I have,\nmaybe with one exception\na decade, \nzip, zilch, and zero respect\nfor anything the NYT\nthinks or believes.</p><p>The Internet permits a <i>news\norganization</i>, maybe\njust some one person,\nto reach nearly everyone\nwho might be interested\nin content from that person.\nFrom that fact,\nI am guessing that the Internet --\nthat does permit <i>deeper</i>\npresentations of information --\nis the key to an\nirresistible, radical\ntransformation of public\nunderstanding\nand effectiveness in\nthe US democracy.</p><p>So, net, with some nuance, \nI disagree with some of the OP\nand conclude that \nthe <i>news</i> and staying informed,\nare important.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13153539,"story_id":13153539,"children":[{"id":13156474,"created_at_i":1481530362,"type":"comment","author":"p10_user","text":"<p>Is there a reason you decided to single out the NYT at the end of your post?

Anger a reader, e.g., can anger some readers by misleading them, and they can be gone in a single click.</p><p>&gt; I like your idea of archiving and summarizing articles you find interesting and meaningful.</p><p>For me, the keys are: (1) Good exploitation of the hierarchical file system on my computer, HPFS on Windows.  (2) A good text editor that has a powerful macro language (KEdit).  (3) A dirt simple way to jump to (go to)  the more heavily used parts of the hierarchical file system tree -- a command line macro G &lt;token&gt; where there is an environment variable of the form &lt;token&gt;.MARK (set from a file a maintain with my editor when a console window opens) with value the tree name of the a particular heavily used part of the tree.  E.g., I can type</p><p>G ASP</p><p>thus make <i>current</i> a \nfile system directory with\nsuch information on \nsome hundreds of references on\nMicrosoft&#x27;s ASP.NET software\nfor building Web pages.  For the\nsoftware for my startup, I have\nnow well over 5000 articles of\ntechnical documentation, and I\ncan find and get to each one\nquickly.  Indeed, commonly\nmy source code comments\nhave my file system tree names\nof relevant documentation,\nand one keystroke in my editor\ninvokes a macro that \ndisplays the documentation.\nRight, the editor macro reads\nand\nparses\nthe line with the tree name, keeps\nthe tree name, and discards\nthe comment delimiters, right,\nwith the comment delimiter\ntokens determined from the\nfile type.</p><p>Then some more command line scripts\nand editor macros make it easy to\ngrab and save content and\nabstract and index it.</p><p>There is one more in a sense above all the rest:  I have a little command line script  FACTS\nthat basically just uses the editor\nto open a file FACTS.DAT (the \nscript does check to see if the file\nis already open and, if so, \ndoes not open it again and instead\n<i>un-hides</i> it and\nraises it to the top of the Z-order).\nThen this file has little notes, often\nas short as a Tweet.  Each note has, right, some key words.  \nUsually there\nare links as Internet URLs or local\nfile system tree names.\nSo, there are phone numbers,\ne-mail addresses, user IDs,\npasswords, street addresses,\nopen hours of businesses,\njust things I want to remember, \netc.</p><p>What is astounding is (1) how\nuseful it is and (2) how few bytes\nit has.  So, since 9&#x2F;2&#x2F;2005, the file has\n2,128,672 bytes and 3811 entries, e.g., an average of about one entry a day.  It is shocking what an effective memory aid that little thing is and even\nsuggests that maybe real AI\nwill need much less memory than\none might guess.  So, right, I have\na few, simple editor macros to help\nme use that file, and with only the  2,128,672 bytes the simplest, least\nefficient text search and select works fine.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13156474,"story_id":13153539,"children":[]}]}]},{"id":13156823,"created_at_i":1481535170,"type":"comment","author":"DanielBMarkham","text":"<p>Nice thesis, especially since I agree with it :)</p><p>A few other things the author failed to note.</p><p>1.

While I get it&#x27;s attractive to target the gaming market because it&#x27;s profitable in the present, it probably means death in the future.

A developer fresh out of college who has a lot of theoretical knowledge but not practical knowledge.  They might still be learning the tools of a professional software developer (source control, testing suites, the debugger, building and deploying environments, etc), technologies (Linq for .Net, Angular for a web dev, etc), techniques (dependency injection, how to write clean code, the value of good logging, etc.), and&#x2F;or how to operate in a professional environment (stand-ups, interacting with coworkers, dealing with having a manager, etc.)</p><p>Junior Dev - I expect you to have learned the things listed above.  You should be proficient in the language or framework.  You should understand the software development process and reliably write &quot;good&quot; code.  Meaning correct, efficient, simple, readable, and maintainable.  Junior developers are still learning design, architecture, domain knowledge, and when to break &quot;the rules&quot;.</p><p>Senior Dev - The best way I can explain what I look for is, &quot;I can give them any assignment and trust they&#x27;ll get it done, well, with little to no help from me.&quot;  Set it and forget it.  Domain knowledge is underrated as a skill but it&#x27;s a super important one.  A senior developer should know the &#x27;gotchya&#x27;s of the particular type of software you make.  (If you make billing software they should have a cursory knowledge of accounting as well as compliance issues).   The code they write should account for not only the particular module they&#x27;re working in but the system as a whole.  It will follow best design patterns, fit inside of our architecture, but won&#x27;t be so dogmatic that it sacrifices performance or maintainability.

State-machine-based <i>programming</i> languages -- usually called <i>synchronous</i> languages (note that TLA+ is <i>not</i> a programming language) -- may be pure, but are not functional. Functional means that you model a computation as a function. In synchronous language and in TLA, a computation is not a function but a <i>behavior</i> -- a sequence of states.

In addition, in TLA the next state is not a <i>function</i> of the current state; (state, nextstate) is a <i>relation</i>, so a state can have multiple possible next state, chosen nondeterministically.

The different forms of Maxwell&#x27;s equations you present are all very much written in the same language of multivariate calculus (but in different words).</p><p>I would present Lamport&#x27;s thesis like this: engineering disciplines usually use a different formalism to <i>reason</i> about system from the one they use to construct it. Consider an electrical engineer designing an analog circuit, and a mechanical engineer designing a contraption made of gears, pulleys and springs. When reasoning about their designs, they can either use the “standard” mathematical approach, plugging in the equations describing what the components do, or invent an algebra of electronic components and an algebra of mechanical components and reason directly in a “language” of capcitors and resistors (one capacitor plus one resistor etc.) or a language of gears and springs. The engineers obviously use a domain-specific tool to design the low-level details of the system, but they use standard math to reason about it (to guide their high-level design and to make sure it achieves what they want). Lamport suggests that software engineers do the same.</p><p>In practice, most software engineers reason about designs only informally, and even then mostly in their heads. This is fine for simple things, but very hard to do when more complex software systems are concerned. The software verification (academic community) indeed uses an approach similar to Lamport (which uses more-or-less simple math to reason about programs), but they hide the techniques from the user, exposing them merely to the results in a sort of a CAD tool. The programming language theory community indeed tries to make mathematical reasoning explicit, but they&#x27;re trying to make reasoning possible <i>within</i> the construction language (like the algebra of gears). There are a few advantages to that approach, but one major disadvantage: because programming languages, as Lamport notes, are so complex, the mathematics required to reason about them syntactically is very arcane and <i>extremely</i> complex; it is very much a completely new math. And because it is so new and so complex, PLT researchers have not yet been able to accomplish the task. Reasoning in that new math is <i>currently</i> much harder and much more limited that in Lamport&#x27;s &quot;simple math&quot; approach[1]. Of course, it&#x27;s possible that PLT will come up with good solutions in the future.</p><p>But in addition to the big pragmatic advantage of Lamport&#x27;s approach (which may be temporary), he claims that using the universal language of &quot;ordinary&quot; math helps find the great similarities between different programs that can be written in many different ways, but are essentially the same. This helps to better understand what computation <i>is</i>, and also helps focus on the core issue -- how the program&#x27;s environment behaves, how the program interacts with it, and why the program&#x27;s behavior achieves its goals -- rather than being distracted right from the beginning by details such as the choice of abstractions (which are important only after the core issues are understood).</p><p>[1]: I sometimes see academic papers about how to reason about pretty basic program properties in Coq that would never be written about Lamport&#x27;s TLA+ for the simple reason that an ordinary engineer would find them almost trivial in TLA+ after only a month or so since first encountering it.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13154764,"story_id":13153846,"children":[{"id":13157332,"created_at_i":1481542500,"type":"comment","author":"fmap","text":"<p>&gt; The programming language theory community indeed tries to make mathematical reasoning explicit, but they&#x27;re trying to make reasoning possible within the construction language (like the algebra of gears).</p><p>We discussed this point before, and this comment finally makes it clear to me why we never saw eye to eye.</p><p>Equational reasoning is <i>a</i> tool for reasoning about programs, but not the only tool. Lamport uses it too, in the form of refinement (this is exactly what is used in practice, outside of &quot;educational&quot; papers about functional programming). More importantly though, nobody insists that all reasoning has to be equational. The Hoare logic and its Owicki-Gries variant for concurrency are the grandfathers of modern program logics, which give you a very precise language (ordinary math + X, same as what Lamport wants) for reasoning about program correctness.</p><p>The only difference in this paper is that Lamport insists that programs should be syntactically represented as state machines, while most PLT people would insist that this is too much of a restriction. Typed programs enable more abstract programs and specifications, because the abstraction mechanism offered by types is in some sense dual to refinement.

Existential types allow you to pick an invariant relation between two implementations. Crucially this invariant does not have to be a (bi)simulation.

You can use higher-order functions to your heart&#x27;s content, as well as higher-order state machines. The machine&#x27;s are abstract, and what constitutes a state is completely up to you. TLA+ is rich enough that you can write an entire program completely using pure functions, that executes as a single TLA step.</p><p>But reasoning with functions is a specific level of abstraction. TLA allows you to go arbitrarily higher or lower. Functions are too high an abstraction if you&#x27;re interested to reason about, say, complexity, and they&#x27;re too low an abstraction if you want to reason about interaction (where they can only constitute single monadic steps). They may be either too high or too low for concurrency.

You can achieve the same thing you can with types in an untyped TLA-based language like TLA+. For example, the typing judgment `f:A-&gt;B` is simply a conjunction with the proposition `f ∈ [A → B]` in TLA+.

In TLA, bisimulation and trace equivalence are the same, and simulation is just trace-inclusion. The famous result &quot;the existence of refinement mapping&quot; by Abadi and Lamport shows that this is complete, namely that any implementation relation &quot;A implements B&quot; can be modeled as &quot;A refines B&quot;, which in TLA translates to the familiar implication operator `A ⇒ B`.

Even without additional political support, clean energy can finally stand on its own.</p><p>TL;DR The question is no longer if we&#x27;ll make it, just when.</p><p>* Solar and wind are stupid cheap now, and getting cheaper, fast. In over 25 states, rooftop solar is a better investment than the S&amp;P500. [1] You&#x27;re seeing Power Purchase Agreements under 3 cents&#x2F;KwH. [2] Solar will only get cheaper. Wind is still being built like crazy in Texas and the central Midwestern US. Some utilities even offer power for free at night wind power is so plentiful (and transmission capability lacking). [3] Tesla&#x2F;SolarCity has already moved into Florida now that the utility-sponsored Amendment 1 failed. (Which was an underhanded utility attempt to hinder rooftop solar deployment)</p><p>* Utility scale battery storage has arrived. Again, its only going to get cheaper (Tesla&#x27;s Gigafactory is a big deal, but lots of other players in the market as well) [4] [5] [6]. Tesla has already installed a microgrid on an island in the Pacific that satisfies all of the island&#x27;s power needs, removing the need for their diesel generators to produce island power.</p><p>* Tesla will deliver its Model 3 in the next 12-18 months. I have no doubt Elon will drive Tesla into scaling up to 1 million vehicles&#x2F;year in production (relying primarily on their recent German manufacturing automation acquisition) [7]. While I would like to see Nissan and GM make EVs that aren&#x27;t purely compliance cars (Bolt? Pleasssssse), I think they&#x27;re good enough for urban dwellers or car share networks where you&#x27;re sticking to major metros. (Full disclosure: TSLA investor)</p><p>* OPEC has finally agreed (after 8 years) to reduce supply to push oil prices back up. Even with US shale coming back online at those profitable market prices ($60-80+&#x2F;barrel) and some of OPEC cheating on those cuts (who wants to reduce their revenue artificially?), that only does one thing: accelerates the transition to EVs. [8]</p><p>* Repealing the Clean Power Plan will not be able to stop the phase out of coal power due to cheap natural gas. Market forces at work. [9]</p><p>* Federal electric vehicle subsides will phase out within the next 2 years for all manufacturers due to hitting the sales quotas dictated by the statute&#x27;s phaseout provisions [10]. No point in trying to remove them.</p><p>* Solar and wind ITC tax credit extensions (to 2021) agreed to by Congress were bipartisan. In exchange, restrictions were removed on the export of crude oil from the US. This agreement will not be unwound.</p><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;solarpowerrocks.com&#x2F;infographics&#x2F;solar-infographic-state-solar-investment-returns&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;solarpowerrocks.com&#x2F;infographics&#x2F;solar-infographic-s...</a></p><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2016-05-03&#x2F;solar-developers-undercut-coal-with-another-record-set-in-dubai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2016-05-03&#x2F;solar-dev...</a></p><p>[3] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;11&#x2F;09&#x2F;business&#x2F;energy-environment&#x2F;a-texas-utility-offers-a-nighttime-special-free-electricity.html?_r=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;11&#x2F;09&#x2F;business&#x2F;energy-environmen...</a></p><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2016-09-15&#x2F;tesla-wins-utility-contract-to-supply-grid-scale-battery-storage-after-porter-ranch-gas-leak\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2016-09-15&#x2F;tesla-win...</a></p><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electrek.co&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;25&#x2F;tesla-powerpack-first-grid-scale-powerpack-installation-asia-pacific&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electrek.co&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;25&#x2F;tesla-powerpack-first-grid-sc...</a></p><p>[6] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electrek.co&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;22&#x2F;tesla-island-microgrid-battery-solar&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electrek.co&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;22&#x2F;tesla-island-microgrid-batter...</a></p><p>[7] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electrek.co&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;08&#x2F;tesla-acquires-german-engineering-firm-create-tesla-advanced-automation-germany&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electrek.co&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;08&#x2F;tesla-acquires-german-enginee...</a></p><p>[8] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2016-11-30&#x2F;opec-said-to-agree-oil-production-cuts-as-saudis-soften-on-iran\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2016-11-30&#x2F;opec-said...</a></p><p>[9] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.utilitydive.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;tva-ceo-clean-power-plan-compliance-natural-gas-part-of-future-strategy&#x2F;431143&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.utilitydive.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;tva-ceo-clean-power-plan-com...</a></p><p>[10] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cleantechnica.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;04&#x2F;19&#x2F;how-the-ev-tax-credit-works-tesla-model-3&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cleantechnica.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;04&#x2F;19&#x2F;how-the-ev-tax-credit-w...</a></p>","points":null,"parent_id":13155303,"story_id":13154966,"children":[{"id":13155716,"created_at_i":1481519607,"type":"comment","author":"prodigal_erik","text":"<p>Urban dwellers park on the street a few blocks away from their upstairs apartment if they&#x27;re lucky.

You can even use bound methods to reuse the component state and props.</p><p><pre><code>  class Navbar {\n    LoginForm = () =&gt; {\n      if (this.state.loggedIn) { ... } else { ... }\n    }\n\n    render() {\n      const {LoginForm} = this\n      return &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;LoginForm &#x2F;&gt;\n      &lt;&#x2F;div&gt;\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n4. And finally, what stops you from creating a custom component that works like this?</p><p><pre><code>  render() {\n    return &lt;If cond={ this.state.loggedIn }&gt;\n      &lt;Then&gt;Hello { this.state.userName }&lt;&#x2F;Then&gt;\n      &lt;Else&gt;Please log in&lt;&#x2F;Else&gt;\n    &lt;&#x2F;If&gt;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s a continuum of ways you can structure your code, it just takes some experimentation to find what works for you.</p><p>After working with Angular templates for a long time and then switching to JSX, I&#x27;m never going back to having my markup in a string blob with magical attributes that make it do stuff.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13151317,"story_id":13151317,"children":[{"id":13153550,"created_at_i":1481493151,"type":"comment","author":"olegkikin","text":"<p>Wow.

The. Money.</p><p>When I first started dabbling in web programming a few years ago, I quickly learned about jQuery from SO while looking up common patterns to create the behaviors I wanted in the browser. But even accounting for my unfamiliarity with the browser paradigm, jQuery always rubbed me the wrong way because of how loosely structured it allowed you to be and the amount of leaky scope it encouraged.</p><p>I finally decided earlier this year it was probably worth my time learning a framework just to get some structure in my code, so I asked a webdev friend if he had any recommendations for a JS framework I should try; he pointed me towards Vue.  I had never heard of it and was skeptical, but I started working through the quickstart guide (Vue docs are great, another +1 to Evan!) and I was hooked before I finished the third example.  It was night and day from jQuery, but easy to learn.  My experience so far is that Vue (in contrast to jQuery) is astoundingly flexible for how terse it is. My code was probably bad, but rewriting a jQuery page in Vue usually halved my linecount.</p><p>&gt;no transpilation</p><p>This is <i>huge</i> to people who just want enough JS to get their proposed feature working and don&#x27;t want their whole site to be JS, and to beginners.  True, at this point I have started getting comfortable with the npm&#x2F;webpack&#x2F;babel&#x2F;es6 stack and I enjoy the things it makes convenient - but at the beginning it&#x27;s a pretty nontrivial learning curve and delayed benefit for a dev team that have probably been doing most things on the server with python or php.</p><p>&gt;Vue.js looks like a nice middle ground... while also nurturing some of [React&#x27;s] ideas</p><p>YES. My first three tries in Vue were basically little calculators that hit some APIs and got some user input and displayed data.  I had no idea what &quot;components&quot; were and my calculators were quick to write and worked great.  I figured that if I ever needed to use components, there was time enough to learn about them later.</p><p>A month later, I decided to dig in and grok React.  After a couple of good tutorials, I finally <i>get</i> components and why they can be great.  I&#x27;ve never used Vue&#x27;s component system, but now I have faith that they are as much a pleasure to use as the rest of it.</p><p>The great thing about Vue is that it&#x27;s modular.  It can be as simple or as powerful as you need.  If you just want to define some behavior and have an object with standardized access to hold the state of your page, you can do that.  If you want to use portable components to reduce duplication of effort, you can do that.  If you want to enforce Flux design, vuex[0] is there for you.  If you want to write a full SPA and need a router, vue-router[1] will do it.  If you want to use JSX, there&#x27;s a Babel plugin[2] for that.  None of these are around to complicate your understanding of things when you&#x27;re learning, but they are easy to plug in when you need them.  This is in pretty strong contrast to my experience with React, where you get hit with a lot all at once.  Admittedly, I jumped quickly into using Redux and websockets because I was using that one great tutorial that everyone links[3] - so maybe React by itself isn&#x27;t too overwhelming.

Certain changes require a revisit to practically all components (e.g. change of &#x27;ready&#x27; to &#x27;mounted&#x27;, v-el to ref etc.) that don&#x27;t really bring a lot of value to the end user other than change in semantics.

They decided they want off the enormous driving force for developer experience that is Facebook, and more importantly the Facebook codebase that shapes decisions in React, see [1] and [2].</p><p>2. They opted out of major innovation that directly stem from (1), see [3].</p><p>3. Parting with Redux, they also decided to part with a community that thinks functionally. This is a big deal not because of writing &quot;pure functional code&quot;, but because these group of people can reason about the implications of bad citizenship on the browser - which really, is something the Javascript community really needs.</p><p>4. Moving away from functional-esque (for lack of a better term), they also move away from predictable testing. Forget purity and sideeffects. A good litmus test - think about how easy it is to test any given framework at scale, and if a framework is &quot;built with testing in mind&quot; (read: angular) how many hacks would be involved. When you have good foundations for testing, you can do this [6] and be sure everything can be covered [7] .</p><p>The only thing I see as a down side with React is the bundle size. The physical size. However I&#x27;m not worried one bit because of (1) and (2).</p><p>For Redux, I take the liberty to use MobX for small-medium projects (which probably is the overwhelming majority of projects), and Redux for large projects, or projects that I want great testing story in (in many ways these correlate, but some times they don&#x27;t).</p><p>Redux is &quot;boilerplatey&quot; because it is highly granular. This is why the ecosystem around it exploded. But because of (3) the ecosystem around it has a sharp focus around the patterns and practices it applies, which makes choosing the &quot;wrong&quot; library not such a big deal; in a sense its ecosystem is predictable, because it is simple.</p><p>JSX or templates, I don&#x27;t think this deserve a major part of the discussion. Both ideas exists for a long while, and even their predecessors exist for more than a few decades [4] and [5]. I don&#x27;t think anyone is tilting the scales any where in a major way. I personally am convinced JSX is a new thing because you have first-class IDE support across the board (which you don&#x27;t have for a given data-properties backed templating language unless it becomes ginormous like Angular). JSX is also simple to hack and you can opt-out or implement your own dumb-templating solution-to-JSX.</p><p>Having said that, I see Vue coupled with PHP quite a bit, like, it&#x27;s an informal standard stack, so it may make sense if you&#x27;re coming from PHP (but then again so did Facebook, right?).

Client was happy that we went the extra mile to take their offhand comment seriously and deliver on it.</p><p>2. Saying &#x27;No&#x27; to &#x27;easy money&#x27; projects.  We&#x27;ve worked with some of our clients for over 20 years now.  Mainly because often when they come to us to add on features to their custom written apps, we often say &#x27;No&#x27;, along with some valid data to explain why we thing the $$$ sunk into the added feature are of very little benefit.</p><p>This has lead to them trusting us a LOT more when we go the other way. Real world case study - we had one client, whom we developed a short term loan application for, ask us to add a Monday morning report with customer mobile numbers so they could do a ring around check for customers who were about to default on their loans.</p><p>I said &#x27;Sure, but lets go one better&#x27;.  I said that along with the report, it wouldn&#x27;t take much extra work to actually have the system send out an SMS message to all those clients as well, with details on their upcoming defaults, and what they needed to do to fix the issue.</p><p>They were delighted and said to go for it.  Well, that was two years ago, and it turns out that the SMS messages by themselves have reduced their default rate by an incredible amount, and they are FAR more profitable as a result.  Hmm, maybe I should have asked for a percentage of profit increase as my payment! :)</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13155589,"story_id":13155589,"children":[]},{"id":13156213,"created_at_i":1481526476,"type":"comment","author":"gmarcus","text":"<p>My business develops mobile apps for clients.

It depends, but I suspect the linked articles fsyncs&#x2F;second is certainly massively excessive.  The &quot;bad&quot; case was after all still just 1&#x2F;50th of a second, i.e. much less than the blink of an eye. My contention is that phones don&#x27;t crash often <i>enough</i> to make sub-second durability worthwhile.  Most phones I come across certainly crash less than once a day, and losing your past 1 second of actions once a day sounds acceptable to me.</p><p>In short: the benchmark is not directly useful.  Perhaps it correlates with some relevant aspect of I&#x2F;O performance (but that&#x27;s not clear), or perhaps software is buggy and actually tries to fsync more than 50 times a second (but then: fix that), but it may simply be a meaningless benchmark.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13169409,"story_id":13155894,"children":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"id":13156774,"children":[]}]}]},{"id":13156703,"created_at_i":1481533448,"type":"comment","author":"blunte","text":"<p>I wonder if this is why my Sony Xperia Z5 is so sluggish sometimes, despite having a Snapdragon 810 8-core CPU...</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13155894,"story_id":13155894,"children":[{"id":13157181,"created_at_i":1481539976,"type":"comment","author":"kimshibal","text":"<p>It&#x27;s not about hardware.

What kind of DC is it? What services do they provide? How long do I want it to take for an employee to get there, whether or not they have 24&#x2F;7 remote hands? What kind of power resiliency do they provide? What will power cost? What kind of power do they provide per cage and rack? How will their uplinks affect my traffic needs? Etc etc.</p><p>Cooling I didn&#x27;t deal with directly, but suffice to say you will always need more cooling, and its efficacy will determine if your hardware stays alive or not. I&#x27;ve seen 11 foot racks with only 6 feet of hardware because they simply couldn&#x27;t cool the racks at full height. Learn how to look for properly designed hot&#x2F;cold racks and keep your racks well organized to make cooling efficient.</p><p>Power is pretty obvious, except that it isn&#x27;t. Eventually you will draw too much power and you&#x27;ll need to shunt machines into different racks and monitor your power trends. So one of the things to consider, besides dual drops, is how many extra racks do I have for when I need to spread out my power OR cooling into new racks?

If space, power, cooling are at a premium, a blade chassis can be handy. But if you can spare the space, power, and cooling, 0.5U and 1U shitboxes are fine for most purposes. Don&#x27;t get wrapped up in the details unless your application design requires specific hardware performance guarantees.</p><p>Looked at iSCSI SANs?

To determine the expected load, I put it under a dummy load that I reasonably considered the maximum for what I would expect on the server (this was a dev machine, so I picked compiling the linux kernel as a benchmark). I ran that until the power stabilized (SuperMicro servers can measure power consumption in hardware and expose this via IPMI - very handy), because power consumption may keep creeping up for a few minutes as the fans adjust to the new operating temperature. I then repeated the same exercise with a CPU torture test (Prime95), just to see what the maximum I could possible get out of the machine was. The numbers turned out to be about 1.8kW for the linux kernel benchmark, and 2.3kW for the torture test. What I ended up doing was to provision for 2kW and use the BIOS&#x27; power limiting feature to enforce this. That would kill the machine if it exceeded its designed load, but that&#x27;s usually better than tripping the breaker and killing the entire circuit. You may also want to talk to your data center provider about overrages.

Presuming that you&#x27;re targeting 12-15kW per rack, a 105W part should allow you to deploy between 60-80 hosts per rack.</p><p>Also, don&#x27;t use a W-series CPU that draws 160W. That&#x27;s crazy power draw per-socket. If you want a super high-end CPU for your database server, I suggest a 2698v4 -- but normally I would go with 2680v4 or 2683v4 depending on the part cost.</p><p>In terms of hard drives, absolutely you should specify HGST over Seagate. At some point you may want to dual source this, but if you&#x27;re only going with one vendor right now HGST is the best option. He8 or He10 8TB are your best bet in terms of cost and availability right now, although start thinking about He10 10T drives. The newly announced He12 drives shouldn&#x27;t be on your radar until Q2 2017. Stock spares, maybe 2-3% of your total drives deployed, but at least 5-6 drives per site. You don&#x27;t want to get caught out if there is a supply shortage when you need it most. Your business depends on ready access to considerable quantities of storage.</p><p>The P-series Intel SSDs are probably not going to be cost effective for your use case. But they are considerably better in terms of IOPS and remove the need for an HBA or RAID controller. Consider a Supermicro 2U chassis with 2.5&quot; NVMe support, which will allow you to go considerably denser than the PCIe form factor. However, I think it&#x27;s too early to go with NVMe unless you truly need beyond-SSD performance.</p><p>Don&#x27;t PXE boot every time you boot. This creates a single point of failure (even if your architecture is redundant), and you will regret this at some point. However, DO PXE boot to install the OS.</p><p>Don&#x27;t use 128GB DIMMs. They are not cost effective today.</p><p>There is only one solution for database scaling: shard. You&#x27;ll either shard it today, or you&#x27;ll shard it tomorrow when the problem is much harder. Scale up each host to what is easily achievable with today&#x27;s hardware, and if push comes to shove retrofit to get over a hump that arises in the future, but know that you MUST shard in order to keep up with demand. Scaling up simply does not work.</p><p>There&#x27;s a lot more to say, but without doing my job for free in a HN comment, the best advice I can offer is:</p><p>1. Simplify what you hope to accomplish in the first round. This is a lot to achieve at once. I think you&#x27;ll have a hard time achieving the fanciness you want from a software perspective while also forklifting the entire stack over to physical hardware. It&#x27;s perfectly fine to have something be good enough for now.</p><p>2. Find people who have done this before and get their advice. Find a VAR you can trust.</p><p>3. Plan, plan, plan, plan. Don&#x27;t commit until you have a plan, make sure the plan is flexible enough to change course without tossing everything out, and plan to do a good enough job to survive long enough to figure out a better plan next time.</p><p>4. Get eval gear, qualify and test things, and make sure that what you think will work does work.</p><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1bbbeMCmqt5pZCb_x2QMWVSL9_e8YGovZthHNGqr5H1A&#x2F;edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1bbbeMCmqt5pZCb_x2QMW...</a></p>","points":null,"parent_id":13153031,"story_id":13153031,"children":[{"id":13154396,"created_at_i":1481501274,"type":"comment","author":"sytse","text":"<p>Thanks!

Longer-distance 25G is awaiting implementations of FEC but the currently shipping gear can do 3-5M - which is about ideal for top-of-rack.

E.g. complement buses with mini-buses and smaller cars to handle overflow. Imagine an Uber-like service with an option to &quot;call a bus&quot; to any number of nearby &quot;bus stops&quot; at a lower price than if you call a car. If a full size bus is within 5 minutes, with space free, it&#x27;ll make you wait for that, otherwise it&#x27;ll dispatch a regular car at the same discounted price.</p><p>You could do away with normal bus schedules in favour of having the buses follow the busiest stretches at any time of day, and use cheaper&#x2F;smaller vehicles to take other passengers.</p><p>E.g. near me the main bus route is used by two very distinct groups of people who either intend to go quite far, or who intend to go to the nearby train stations or high streets in either direction from me. During certain parts of the day the riders are often dominated by one or the other, and you&#x27;d get far more efficient use if you could shuttle people between the train stations&#x2F;high streets and the longer distances separately. Knowing the start&#x2F;end of each journey would allow you to &quot;sort&quot; the riders accordingly and dispatch vehicles much closer to optimal.</p><p>&gt; And the &quot;increade density, reduce parking requirements&quot; — if you do that, you can just improve transit, and get the same advantage.</p><p>See above - automated vehicles will change transit too, but there are lots of situations where people still want to go door to door and are willing to pay accordingly. E.g. I take the bus from the local train station and home most of the time, but if I&#x27;m in a rush I might not be able to wait. Sometimes currently that&#x27;s frustrating as getting a taxi her normally will take me 5 minutes. If I&#x27;m in a rush and there&#x27;s a bus &lt;10 minutes away, there&#x27;s certainly a non-zero chance that the taxi will be late and the bus fast, and the bus will arrive first and I have to consider if I want to cancel the taxi or wait and be later than if I&#x27;d just taken the bus in the first place.</p><p>With a &quot;combo service&quot; with guaranteed pickup from specific locations in &lt;5m by <i>either</i> bus&#x2F;min-bus&#x2F;car at the same price depending on what&#x27;s closest, I think you&#x27;d see a lot more people here opting for something like that than people who currently use the bus, which could very well have the effect of making it viable to use far more buses.</p><p>A lot of the car users I see here (London suburb) mostly use public transport anyway, and have the car as &quot;just in case&quot; that will be increasingly hard to justify with solutions like the above.</p><p>Couple that with increasing pressure to reduce the number of allowed parking spaces in new developments further and it will keep getting less desirable to own cars many places.</p><p>&gt; People want to own a car, have it always available, and don&#x27;t want to share.</p><p>Do they? A lot of people feel they <i>need</i> a car, but I think far fewer <i>want</i> a car if they felt they had better options. Personally I don&#x27;t even have a drivers license. Sometimes think about getting one, but it&#x27;s an annoying time commitment for little benefit, when I can have a car here with a driver in 5 minutes so I can relax and read or play a game while I get to my destination. Ten years ago it was more annoying, but now it&#x27;s gotten to a point where I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get a drivers license in my lifetime (I&#x27;m 40), as the inconveniences keep dropping. The one remaining thing that makes me sometimes wish I had a car is for road trips on holidays to places outside of bus routes where it&#x27;s expensive to hire a driver - self driving cars will take away that inconvenience too.</p><p>A lot of people do want to own a car still, but I suspect that car ownership will start trending downwards very quickly once self-driving cars drive the cost of car sharing services down further and make it easier to provide better guaranteed availability and shorter waits and more flexibility (e.g. get whatever type of car you happen to need)</p><p>A lot of people also have conflicting wants. E.g. they may actually want to own a car, but want that next holiday more, and so opt out of car ownership once a shared one ends up sufficiently cheaper.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13157302,"story_id":13155600,"children":[{"id":13159061,"created_at_i":1481558984,"type":"comment","author":"ghaff","text":"<p>&gt;Providing dense parking garages gets a lot easier if it doesn&#x27;t need to be omfortable for people to get to the cars and you don&#x27;t need to be able to open the doors when parked etc.</p><p>You mean like they do in Manhattan today?</p><p>&gt;But self-driving cars can be used to augment the transit system too.</p><p>Here&#x27;s the thing.

I am not saying this is exactly how it goes as I haven&#x27;t the slightest what goes on behind the closed doors at ADP (and use µblock0 myself); nor do I endorse the idea of using one company to coerce another, but I would imagine that it allows for at least a channel for more direct responses as to why an ad is not acceptable.</p><p>That is, I do not believe that other solutions have a very clear way for advertisers to determine what is and isn&#x27;t acceptable; for the sake of argument, this puts aside the fact that some unacceptable aspects of ads should be common sense (loud noises, pop-unders, fake download links, etc). Basically when an adblocking user reaches the site, they have no means of communicating why they dislike the ads on that site - most of the time, it&#x27;s just a blanket block that users never think about. So even if you really like a website and would love to support it through the ad revenue, your current options don&#x27;t send a very clear signal as to what was disruptive and dislikable.</p><p>Again, I&#x27;m not saying I fully agree with this, but I think it&#x27;s an argument that has some value, and reflects the greater difficulty with advertising in general; it&#x27;s a one-way communication venue, and the few times that we as viewers are able to get a signal back to the other side, it&#x27;s usually ignored until legislation gets involved. (See the CALM Act and it&#x27;s overall ineffectiveness [1]) Basically there isn&#x27;t really much control over what advertisers actually do, and even Truth in Advertising laws basically have no teeth except for extremely blatant falsehoods.</p><p>Adblocking is the first major way that viewers have been able to push back against advertising, and I&#x27;m with that 100% since I just think it&#x27;s pointless in and of itself - it&#x27;s wasteful in my opinion how much infrastructure exists out there just for the sake of providing advertisements. But I also understand that likely advertising isn&#x27;t going away, so having some method to signal back clearly and directly to advertisers what is wrong with an ad is good in my mind. Said signal having some teeth to make sure they get the message is also important, else it&#x27;s not much better than before. But not giving any indication as to what&#x27;s wrong doesn&#x27;t really help either. (I&#x27;m not blaming anyone but stubborn advertisers here, but I think it helps us as activists if we can make it 100% what we don&#x27;t like about specific advertisements instead of just doing a blanket block).</p><p>[1] = <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fcc.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;policy&#x2F;loud-commercials\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fcc.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;policy&#x2F;loud-commercials</a></p>","points":null,"parent_id":13152403,"story_id":13150639,"children":[]},{"id":13152702,"created_at_i":1481484869,"type":"comment","author":"a3n","text":"<p>&gt;  I suspect most novice users will never do this.</p><p>I suspect most novice users will never install uBlock, because the article they read in &lt;whatever&gt; will mention ABP.  :)</p><p>It just depends on what makes sense for the individual, a default whitelist because you want to support some advertising (that is, if you thought about it at all), or default black everything.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13152403,"story_id":13150639,"children":[]},{"id":13152982,"created_at_i":1481487809,"type":"comment","author":"morgante","text":"<p>A lot of quality content I find is on niche blogs where I might only read an article or two.
