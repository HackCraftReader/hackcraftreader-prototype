The provision for defense must in this, as in all other cases, be made commensurate to the danger of attack. Ambition must be made to counteract ambition. The interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place. It may be a reflection on human nature, that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government. But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.&quot;</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13162298,"story_id":13161155,"children":[]},{"id":13163040,"created_at_i":1481584966,"type":"comment","author":"SerpentJoe","text":"<p>Possibly because they won&#x27;t be doing it, or at least not going so far as to unconstitutionally refuse to hold hearings on Supreme Court replacements.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13162298,"story_id":13161155,"children":[{"id":13165013,"created_at_i":1481611218,"type":"comment","author":"bmelton","text":"<p>On what grounds do you find a refusal to consent to an executive&#x27;s appointment to be unconstitutional?

In many ways, he anticipated the efficiency studies of engineer Frederick Winslow Taylor. Regarding each plant as infinitely perfectible, he created an atmosphere of ceaseless improvement. Paradoxically, the mammoth scale of operations encouraged close attention to minute detail, for a penny saved in one place might then be multiplied a thousandfold throughout the empire. In the early 1870s, Rockefeller inspected a Standard plant in New York City that filled and sealed five-gallon tin cans of kerosene for export. After watching a machine solder caps to the cans, he asked the resident expert: “How many drops of solder do you use on each can?” “Forty,” the man replied. “Have you ever tried thirty-eight?” Rockefeller asked. “No? Would you mind having some sealed with thirty-eight and let me know?”34 When thirty-eight drops were applied, a small percentage of cans leaked—but none at thirty-nine. Hence, thirty-nine drops of solder became the new standard instituted at all Standard Oil refineries. “That one drop of solder,” said Rockefeller, still smiling in retirement, “saved $2,500 the first year; but the export business kept on increasing after that and doubled, quadrupled—became immensely greater than it was then; and the saving has gone steadily along, one drop on each can, and has amounted since to many hundreds of thousands of dollars.”</p><p>Rockefeller performed many similar feats, fractionally reducing the length of staves or the width of iron hoops without weakening a barrel’s strength[...]</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13161155,"story_id":13161155,"children":[{"id":13164078,"created_at_i":1481597734,"type":"comment","author":"pekk","text":"<p>A hero of micromanagement!</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13162642,"story_id":13161155,"children":[]},{"id":13162809,"created_at_i":1481583148,"type":"comment","author":"hackuser","text":"<p>Interesting story; thanks.

The thing is that no one needs to &quot;learn the whole org mode&quot;; you take it in piece by piece, based on the features you need. I started off learning just the (1) org markup syntax, and exporting. You write once, and then export the same to HTML, PDF, markdown, plain ASCII text, etc. Then I learned (2) Org capture.. taking notes at whim of a moment, dumping all notes in a single file (you don&#x27;t have to do it in a single file) categorized by tags. Then I wanted to take notes with &quot;living code&quot;.. notes that contain the code as well as the code output. So that was learning (3) Org babel. Then I wanted the notes to generate files containing the code in those notes. Enter (4) Org tangle. One day I felt like why not experiment with (5) Org table that is plain text spreadsheet that can contain formulas too. It truly is a beautiful piece of software. At some point, I started tinkering with elisp, and started appreciating the org mode design even more. I felt a need to have some thing like the default ASCII exporter, but few of my own tweaks. (6) And I learnt how to design my own custom org exporter.</p><p>And I believe that all of that is probably less than 50% of the whole of org mode. I will learn more as and when I feel the need.

You have commands (delete, copy, make uppercase,...), and a number of movements (right, down, to the next occurrence of a word, to line 27,...) or objects (word, line, paragraph, html tag, text within quotes, ...) to work on. These can be combined in any way you like, any command can be applied to any movement or object. So if you have a plugin like vim-angry that adds a &quot;C-style function parameter&quot; text object, all the commands you know can be applied to that. In contrast, in emacs, you have a number of commands (kill-line, kill-word, ...), and that&#x27;s it. You have to get by with those. If they didn&#x27;t implement the command you&#x27;d like to use, tough luck.</p><p>A second (minor) reason for me is that I work in the embedded software world, and usually on an embedded linux, there&#x27;s at least some variant of vim or vi available, while emacs is very rare.</p><p>Take my advice with a grain of salt : I&#x27;ve never really used emacs, so I can&#x27;t compare from first hand. From what I&#x27;ve heard, emacs is also a very good editor. To me, the question &quot;should I use vim or emacs&quot; is more or less the same as &quot;should I use firefox or chrome&quot; - I&#x27;m a chrome guy myself, but I don&#x27;t consider firefox to be crap, nor its users to be idiots. Internet explorer on the other hand,...</p><p>So my advice : learn vim. And if you don&#x27;t, learn emacs. Just learn to use either one properly, and you&#x27;ll be way faster at editing than people who don&#x27;t use those.</p><p>[0] a.o. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@mkozlows&#x2F;why-atom-cant-replace-vim-433852f4b4d1#.ot06wyos5\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@mkozlows&#x2F;why-atom-cant-replace-vim-43385...</a></p>","points":null,"parent_id":13158375,"story_id":13157497,"children":[{"id":13159009,"created_at_i":1481558657,"type":"comment","author":"omaranto","text":"<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m convinced by the composability argument. Isn&#x27;t composable the default for text editors? Emacs (and most text editors) let you select a portion of text (Emacs calls this marking a region) and then decide what to do with it: delete it, cut it (Emacs calls this killing), convert to upper case, etc. Vim mostly uses the other order: Commands first, motion or text object later (except in visual mode where it&#x27;s like other editors: Select something first,  command later).</p><p>So you just need to implement a bunch of selection commands to get Vim-style composability. I think lots of these modern text editors like sublime or atom come with select word, select parenthesized expression, select paragraph, etc. If the editor is extensible you can define new selection commands and compose them with the existing commands that operate on a region, just like Vim. Emacs certainly has a bunch of marking commands.</p><p>The extra commands you mentioned in Emacs (kill-word, kill-line, etc.) are just for convenience: Shortcuts for common cases. In Vim you can delete to the end of the word with dw. In Emacs you could also do a 2 keystroke solution: do mark-word, delete-region (you could use backspace, Control D or delete for that second second thing since they &quot;operate on the region of the selection is active&quot;, so C-@ &lt;backspace&gt; would do it).

My gut feeling tells me that vim will still have more &quot;targets&quot; for a command, and more accurate ones, but I&#x27;m biased.</p><p>But the &quot;select text and then apply command&quot;, as I understand it, still has a major drawback compared to vim&#x27;s way of working : the dot-command. In vim, you go &quot;daa&quot; (delete an argument - i.e. delete the argument, including the comma which separates it, if you have the vim-angry plugin).

Textadept doesn&#x27;t offer counts, I believe. I think counts are probably an advantage of Vim and Emacs over most(?) other editors.</p><p>3. About Vim having more motions &amp; text objects: Probably, but Emacs is close. Without extra packages you have: words, symbols and S-expressions (the names come from Lisp but these do something sensible in most languages: Symbol is usually identifier and S-expression is something like delimited expression: A string, a parenthesized expression, a block in curly braces or brackets, etc.), lines,  sentences, and paragraphs. Texts packages add other targets like LaTeX environment. One thing definitely lacking in Emacs is that Vim usually offers two variants that differ slightly at the ends (like w vs e, or i( vs a(), those minor variations are pretty useful.</p><p>My point is just the saying other editors don&#x27;t have the ability to combine commands with different things to operate on is obviously false, and claiming is unlikely to convert anytime to Vim.

What I was saying is that it is not unique to Vim. Vim uses &quot;command; motion-or-textobject&quot; in normal mode where most editors use &quot;select-what-you-want; command&quot; (which is what Vim does in visual mode). If your editor has a good stock of selection commands (some have select word, line, paragraph, parenthesized expression, etc. -- I don&#x27;t use atom but Emacs and Textadept have all those and more, like select LaTeX environment) and a good stock of commands that operate on the selection (like delete, cut, wrap in parenthesis, uppercase, etc.), I&#x27;d say you have composable editing.</p><p>I don&#x27;t think the link you have addresses my point at all.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13160095,"story_id":13157497,"children":[{"id":13163680,"created_at_i":1481591757,"type":"comment","author":"alwillis","text":"<p>It seems pretty clear to me that it does indeed address your point.</p><p>That you can build up sophisticated actions just by knowing the primitives and text objects is the point, right? And not having to memorize different commands and different selections.</p><p>From the article:</p><p><i>But now let’s look at delete commands. Let’s say you want to delete a word, delete to the end of the line, delete to the end of the file, or delete to the end of a paragraph.\nEmacs only has two of these functions: kill-word and kill-line. Atom has the same two, more or less: deleteToEndOfWord() and deleteLine().</p><p>Vim, though, is different. Vim only has one command: d, which is “delete.” What does it delete? You name it, literally. The d command gets combined together with those commands for movement: dw deletes to the next word, d$ to the end of the line, dG to the end of the file, and d} to the end of the paragraph.</p><p>This is where Vim’s composability leads to its power. Emacs and Atom don’t have commands for deleting to the end of a file or a paragraph — even when they have commands to move to those places. But in Vim, if you can move to a location, you can delete to that location.</p><p>And composability is about more than just power, it’s also about learnability and consistency. The command for copying text in Vim is y. Do you know how to copy to the end of the line&#x2F;file&#x2F;paragraph? Of course you do: It’s y$, yG, and y} respectively. The command for increasing the indent is &gt;, so you instantly know &gt;$, &gt;G, and &gt;}.

They tend to be called mark-something. There are commands for selecting words, sentences, paragraphs, function definitions, S-expressions (the name comes from Lisp but they&#x27;re defined to be something useful in every language, usually something like &quot;any delimited construct in the language --strings, blocks, array literals, etc.&quot;). Once you select something you can apply many actions to it: you can delete it, uppercase it, rot13 it, sort the lines in it, wrap it in parenthesis, etc.</p><p>Maybe what tripped the author up is that additionally Emacs has other commands like kill-word, kill-line that are shortcuts for common combinations of a motion and a command. The author is correct in saying that these convenience commands are not composable, but they&#x27;re nice shortcuts to have (and by the way, contrary to what the author says Emacs does have a kill-paragraph command).</p><p>So you to delete a word you can do:</p><p>Vim: dw</p><p>Emacs composable style: M-@ C-D (that is, mark-word delete-\nregion[^1])</p><p>Emacs shortcut: M-D (kill-word)</p><p>Atom composable style: Option-Shift-f backspace</p><p>Atom shortcut: Option-d</p><p>(I got the Atom ones by Googling, I don&#x27;t if they are right, but if they&#x27;re not, I&#x27;m pretty sure correct ones exist: Atom has both a composable way and a shortcut.)</p><p>Vim propaganda should stop saying other editors lack composable commands. Even notepad.exe lets me use any of its paltry motion commands[^2] available to select something and then use a generic delete command to delete whatever I selected. &quot;Composability&quot; is the default mode of operation of most text editors.</p><p>Vim propaganda should focus instead on the very real advantages than Vim&#x27;s command model has. For example:</p><p>- dot repeats the whole command&#x2F;motion pair. This is fabulous!</p><p>- Vim has counts so you can delete 9 words just as easily as 3 words. (Emacs also has them, but lots of editors don&#x27;t, and they&#x27;re superhandy.)</p><p>- Vim has lots of little variations of the motions and textobjects so you can pick exactly what you need, other editors tend to have fewer. For example, for words, Vim has w, e, aw, iw (and probably others I&#x27;m forgetting) which are related but a little bit different.</p><p>(Also, personally I think Vim bloggers should recognize that those non-composable commands like kill-word are nice optional shortcuts, that are actually a tiny advantage other editors have over Vim.

For example, AucTeX has a command to mark a LaTeX environment, but it also should have what Vim would call &quot;inner LaTeX environment&quot;. As a more basic example, I wrote my own mark-line command because what I want to do with lines isn&#x27;t always kill them! With builtins I think the best way to mark 5 whole lines starting from the one you&#x27;re one is C-a C-SPC C-5 C-n, which is awful.

For that reason, and because HPC has traditionally been thought to need DP, IIRC no public roadmap mentioned Maxwell Tesla at all. Instead, the GK210 (K80) was the attempt to be the bridge-gap chip for HPC until Pascal; it was released just a few months before the big GM200 consumer chips came out. That is until fall &#x27;15 when the late arriving M40 and M4 were pitched as &quot;Deep learning accelerators&quot; (though GRID&#x2F;virtualization version were released a little earlier in August). Quite obvious naming, plus no sane HPC shop would buy a crippled (no DP) chip &lt;1 year before the promised miracle-chip, Pascal was planned to be released.  Let&#x27;s not forget that P100 was known to be quite late, K80 was insufficient for the needs of many customers, so another bridge-gap was necessary, and that what the M Teslas were: bridge-gap ML&#x2F;DL cards that Google&#x2F;FB&#x2F;Baidu and the like wanted, and picked up pretty quickly e.g. see [1].</p><p>&gt; As for the half precision, it&#x27;s pretty much the same thing NVIDIA been doing since Kepler dumping FP64 and FP16, especially FP16 due to the silicon costs.</p><p>Not really.

First, you need to separate the mechanism used to express voter preference (i.e the ballot design), from the method used to choose the winner. Those are separate things that, in theory, can be mixed-and-matched to produce various voting systems.</p><p>In terms of ballot designs, they are basically all just restricted subsets of the &quot;score&quot; voting ballot. That is, any voter preference that can be expressed in an &quot;approval&quot;, &quot;ranked choice&quot;, &quot;ranked choice with ties&quot;, or traditional &quot;single choice&quot; ballot, can also be expressed with a &quot;score&quot; ballot.</p><p>That means every voting system is a &quot;score ballot&quot; system with some restrictions applied to the ballot. This means that, for example, you could have an election where you allow the voter to choose whichever ballot they are most comfortable with. Then you just interpret the ballot as a score ballot.</p><p>There are multiple ways to choose a winner from a set of score ballots. But debating between them is counterproductive to getting better voting systems adopted. Just start off with one that&#x27;s easy to understand (i.e. &quot;sum of ratings&quot;, or &quot;only the first choice counts&quot;), and worry about improving it later.</p><p>The important thing is to give the voter the option to use a more expressive ballot. Whichever one they feel most comfortable with. You could even make it so that initially, all ballots are converted to traditional &quot;single choice&quot; ballots for tallying, but let voters know how the vote would have turned out under other evaluation methods (like &quot;sum of ratings&quot; and Schulze). I think voters would quickly realize the value of counting all of their expressed preferences.</p><p>...</p><p>But that is a very cool site.

You might need to start off with conversion to traditional &quot;single choice&quot;, because it&#x27;s hard to argue against adopting it. That is, you&#x27;re not actually changing the election system at all. You&#x27;re just allowing people to optionally express extra information about their preferences in a way that does not affect the election. But it will give each voter a chance to, if they want, try out more expressive ballots (which will presumably be appealing to most people once they get the hang of it), and the public will be told how the election would have resulted under the other two evaluation systems. Presumably, a more &quot;centrist&quot; candidate would generally have won. And after a few election cycles, people will be able to form an opinion on which evaluation system they think produces the best results.</p><p>I think the reason why electoral system change has so often been met with public resistance is that most people don&#x27;t have a feel for how the results would change, and nobody is offering them a chance to get familiar with a different election system without an up-front commitment to the change.</p><p>If you can get people to accept the &quot;sum of ratings&quot; evaluation method, then I say be happy with that. The fact that &quot;sum of ratings&quot; is arguably not as good as Schulze is a very high class problem to have. (Btw I&#x27;m using Schulze as a stand-in for any &quot;good but complex&quot; evaluation system.) Anyway, I&#x27;m not sure the improvement in evaluation is worth having an evaluation system that most people wouldn&#x27;t understand.</p><p>So just to sum up, I think what I&#x27;m proposing is different and more acceptable in that:</p><p>i) It allows people to use whichever ballot they feel most comfortable with, knowing that no matter which ballot they choose, their vote will count as much as any other voter.</p><p>ii) It allows voters, if they so choose, to get familiar with the more expressive ballots and different evaluation methods without committing to any change in the election system.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13163790,"story_id":13161396,"children":[]}]}]},{"id":13167874,"created_at_i":1481645730,"type":"comment","author":"hash-set","text":"<p>&quot; In 2011, almost a full quarter of young Americans said democracy was a &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;very bad&quot; way to run a country.

Now, Johnson&#x27;s policies are fairly fringe and weird, and so are the other third party candidate&#x27;s (Stein), but that&#x27;s because serious candidates don&#x27;t run on third party tickets that have no chance of winning.

Well, except that that would also fundamentally change the coverage of the race, so there&#x27;s no reason to expect the election would go anywhere near the same way overall (it would probably be less polarized), but the point is that to the limited extent the survey results reflect this hypothetical world, they don&#x27;t cast it in a bad light.</p><p>Edit: Also, I like Clinton, but her being the Concordet winner doesn&#x27;t mean much in terms of that world either.

Fuck &#x27;em, what&#x27;ll they do -- vote Republican? To make your preference unambiguous by an actual vote, under our system, you have to be seriously into the fringe. This creates a kind of activation-energy barrier to coordinating on a change: very many people can feel that, say, smoking pot is OK, without their preference mattering -- without it even affecting their vote. This fraction could even exceed 50%, unless it&#x27;s <i>common knowledge</i> that it&#x27;s over 50%: you don&#x27;t &quot;throw away&quot; your vote when you expect everyone else to also vote strategically according to preferences which aren&#x27;t common knowledge.</p><p>So a voting system with less of a strategy problem could make common knowledge of real voter preferences easier to arrive at -- the preferences people would honestly vote by, given the chance.

Research wants to be free, and there is no reason it shouldn&#x27;t be. Fortunately (for now at least; researchers are being replaced by adjuncts in too many places) the open source model is sustainable. Universities hire us (at somewhat modest salaries) to teach classes and to write TPS reports from time to time, and to actively maintain a presence in the research community. And grant-making agencies such as the NSF are delighted to have the results of their funding disseminated as widely and as openly as possible.</p><p>It&#x27;s not perfect, but to a large extent (at least outside the laboratory sciences) we have the luxury of simply contributing to knowledge without worrying too much about where our next paycheck will come from.

It is an arXiv overlay journal, meaning they do not publish articles (even electronically).

It&#x27;s everything that academics could want from a journal, with none of the cruft. If I ever do any research in the area of the journal then I am definitely submitting here.

Also, having a non-user-replaceable battery means that the device will only live for so long, and I&#x27;m really trying to limit my consumption of disposable technology.</p><p>I think that, for now, my most optimistic case for smartwatches is that they&#x27;re at about the same phase as handheld computing was 15 or so years ago.

Theoretically, this is awesome since at the time of writing the backend service you don&#x27;t always know which fields and relationships a consumer might require.

You could perform validations on incoming query parameters and mutations. It also helps clients understand the underlying schema and would serve as excellent documentation.

As far as I recall, databases do implement access control at table level, but often you need better control than that.</p><p>In the system that I most recently worked on we had to implement our own access control logic as table level was too coarse. It was a datacenter management system which supported multiple users, each with a set of roles, and each user belonging to several companies. The data center inventory that would be returned by queries depended both upon your role (sysadm vs customer admin vs regular Joe) and upon your company affiliation.

I&#x27;ll assume that&#x27;s what you mean. My best advice would be to profile your system to see how it behaves at great load. If access control turns out to be a problem, maybe you are doing too complex joins. One path forward may be to &quot;denormalize&quot; your database scheme, i.e. accept that the same information is stored in several places for the sake of efficiency. Another idea is to spin up an Elastic Search box to help with the query that is your #1 bottleneck.</p><p>2) As for the question about individual database connections, well, I think I&#x27;d pool them or I would build upon some framework or app server which pools them.

But maybe if they&#x27;re cheap enough to produce and easy enough to mass up, you don&#x27;t have to even be that effective.</p><p>Here&#x27;s where my intuition is anchored, and you can figure if it&#x27;s applicable (because I worked in a very different field). In magnetron sputtering, you ionize a gas as it passes through a strong magnetic field (harddrive magnet strength). Once the molecule ionizes (since it&#x27;s moving at sonic speeds in the vacuum), it whips around and slams into some target, blasting molecules back from the target like a shotgun to a pile of dirt. These sputtered molecules&#x2F;bits of material may be slightly charged, and when they hit the substrate will carry that charge and deposit it onto the substrate. Over time an insulating substrate (like glass) will charge up a bit, and this will begin to repulse incomming splattered charged bits. It&#x27;d be called something like &#x27;biasing&#x27; and slows down the deposition rate, since the incomming material may slow too much to properly embed itself on the substrate. The magnets behind the target also trap electrons (in what is often called a racetrack), which helps amplifies ionizing the gases (since a strong field may not ionize the incoming gas molecules, but plonking an extra electron onto it will).</p><p>It tends to be a game of small effects in big numbers. Any individual interaction can vary wildly from one interaction to another, but over many trillions of trillions of events it averages out like you&#x27;d expect scales similar to Avagadro&#x27;s number to. So if we could fabricate stupefying amouts of these gizmos, you wouldn&#x27;t need it to be completely effective; just enough biasing or field strength to tilt the odds a bit in your favor and a lot of the little chips could survive. And if you have enough, you win! Sure the solor wind may clobber a few chips, but if you have billions enough of them, perhaps enough survive to keep effective.</p><p>This is part of the approach to some MEMS gizmos, where you play the odds and make huge numbers of the gizmos with a cheap fast process and filter out the working ones. Ideally you&#x27;d be smart and just have a really good process, but if your fabrication process is messy or too hard to control and the gizmo valuable enough you can take the losses. (I mean, you don&#x27;t do that - you engineer good processes! But... well, that can be expensive. And sometimes waste is cheaper.)</p><p>EDIT: I&#x27;m thinking of the spherical cow equivalent of a gizmo here, too. You prolly wouldn&#x27;t make billions of little computers and hork them at another star system unless you could essentially replicate them chemically. But not with a photolithographic process typical to chip designs. You can get millions, not trillions of trillions. Have something that self-assembles in a beaker and then perhaps it becomes an option. But that&#x27;s sort of like hurling a viral infection at another star system, and... well, kinda gunks the idea too.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13164040,"story_id":13161879,"children":[{"id":13164417,"created_at_i":1481602976,"type":"comment","author":"jayajay","text":"<p>Your example (sputtering charge onto insulator) is of a similar flavor (but with E fields).

On top of that, and unlike the current process, if I&#x27;m understanding correctly, they also make it explicit to the seller why their house is worth what it is. And I can&#x27;t belabor that point enough: the reason the residential real estate market is so opaque is because of the uncertainty&#x2F;inaccuracy around pricing. Realtors do their best to determine value, but there is a specific reason properties sell in 2 days (priced low) or 6 months (priced high) and it&#x27;s strictly because of erroneous pricing (btw, this isn&#x27;t true in SF, for instance, where agents intentionally price low to get bidding wars, but that is not the norm nationwide). We&#x27;ve reached this point where the data is largely available so that the historical method of picking a few &quot;comps,&quot; licking your finger and seeing which way the wind&#x27;s blowing will soon be a thing of the past and that&#x27;s the crux of what OD is doing. If that means they&#x27;re not fundamentally changing the market, I&#x27;d ask you to look into how property gets priced today by the two parties responsible for making sure the deal gets done (the broker&#x2F;agent and the appraiser).</p><p>As for how the seller perceives things, if I tell a seller your home is worth X, and here&#x27;s all the data supporting that--actually quantifying why your friend John&#x27;s house down the block sold for 5% above what we&#x27;re offering you--the seller is informed and can decide if they&#x27;re willing to assume those risks I mentioned above to get a higher price than OD is offering. Assuming I have a house at the average US home price ($190k or so?), if you tell me that I can take OD&#x27;s $186k &quot;no risk&quot; offer or wait it out and hopefully get the full 190k given all those risks mentioned above, I suspect many people would just take the 186 and move on.

And of course if this ends up working at scale for OD every deep-pocketed institution will create divisions that do this as well, which will just mean that OD is the first of many new-age residential real estate broker (call them a market maker or REIT if you like that label better, but everyone will sell in this more liquid, transparent way in the future... how long will that take?

Usually the seller will hire a real estate agent, who helps the seller determine what to ask for the home.  Then, the sellers agent will be responsible for listing and marketing the home.

Maybe somthing is noted on the inspection- the buyer might ask the seller to pay for a repair, and the seller decides not to.

My offer was accepted, so I had  it inspected.  The roof was really the only concern, the inspector felt that it should be replaced.  I told the seller about the problem, and they decided that they were not going to pay anything towards a new roof, so we mutually agreed to nullify the contract.</p><p>Later I found another home- it passed all inspections, but the appraisal came in $900 less than what I had offered.  The seller was going through a bankruptcy and had to have the sell approved by the bankruptcy judge, and since they had already approved it at my asking price, it was not worth delaying the closing over getting the price reduced $900, so the bank and I agreed that I would just pay an additional $900 down at closing to bring the debt&#x2F;value ratio to where they wanted it, and we closed.  (If it had been a more significant proce difference, that may not have worked out, resulting in another voided contract.)</p><p>In other cases, financing may not come through- the lender will pre-approve the buyer, but that is not a guarantee- the lender can decide they don&#x27;t want to lend on a property due to the condition or something else, they may discover something during underwriting they weren&#x27;t aware of about the buyer, the buyers situation may have changed, or the market conditions for loans may have changed (interest rates increased); all of which may result in a denied loan, and thus a voided contract.</p><p>Real estate agent are supposed to make this all as smooth as possible and help inform buyers and sellers to minimize the risk of any of these things happening.</p><p>I agree that with modern technology the current commission structure is probably not optimal, though.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13182395,"story_id":13164026,"children":[]}]}]},{"id":13179032,"created_at_i":1481744588,"type":"comment","author":"harmmonica","text":"<p>It <i>is</i> bizarre.

FWIW, I was mostly a buyer&#x27;s agent; the few listings that I took on were only for valued, returning clients and some REO&#x27;s (mostly because it was a great way to meet potential buyers). (EDIT: I mention this because I&#x27;d never claim that everyone should use a listing agent, or that paying a listing agent 3% is necessarily good value for the service they perform)</p><p>I don&#x27;t mean to sound overly negative here, but 6-12% seems like a pretty big cut. I understand the argument that the seller may be able to sell the house more quickly than via a traditional listing, but they are also taking on a fair bit of risk and headache as well (no guidance on making disclosures, no access to the standard forms, no unbiased opinion about true market value, etc).</p><p>It&#x27;s not really an apples-to-apples comparison to say &quot;you would have paid 6% anyways&quot;, because if they had paid 6% (or 4-5%) to a listing agent they&#x27;d get all the guidance&#x2F;forms&#x2F;advice I mentioned above, as well as someone actively marketing their property, MLS listing (thereby reaching a much larger market of potential buyers). From your website, it also seems like there is essentially no room for negotiations on adjustments for repairs.</p><p>Honestly, this seems like a variant of &quot;we buy houses for cash&quot;, except &quot;on the web&quot; (admittedly, most of those folks try to buy properties at 30% below market value - but I&#x27;d wager that you&#x27;re probably trying for around 15% below market in some cases).  In most markets, if someone lists their house for 5% below true market value, they&#x27;re likely to get several offers rather quickly. I&#x27;d also guess that you have your own contract, as opposed to standard Realtor contracts which limit your risk in terms of earnest money deposit, contingency removal time periods, etc. It really seems to me that the only people who would go for this are people who are rather ignorant about how to sell their real estate and therefore at a pretty big disadvantage when dealing with a very experienced buyer, such as Opendoor.</p><p>Also, it&#x27;s kind of silly to give as much emphasis to the home warranty you give buyers - that&#x27;s a pretty cheap &amp; easy thing to obtain; most agents I know give them to their buyer as standard practice.</p><p>Again, I hope this doesn&#x27;t come off as too negative - I think there&#x27;s a lot of room for innovation in real estate; this just doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s actually advantageous for most sellers in my opinion, and therefore not particularly scalable once people start doing the math.

A few things to note:</p><p>1. Every time we improve our valuation model, we limit the scope of adverse selection. A more accurate model means there is less tail in the error distribution, which means we are less like to acquire a home we have mistakenly overvalued. As we improve our model accuracy over time through feature modifications and training on more data, the adverse selection problem will partially self-correct.</p><p>2. Every time we reduce our fees, we limit the scope of adverse selection. Improvements to our operational efficiency mean we face lower costs, which over time will allow us to offer fees more on par with or below current market norms. When we offer high fees we run the risk that the only ones accepting those offers are those where we&#x27;ve missed something important about the home. Fee reductions help us limit the scope of this problem, and buy more typical homes.</p><p>3. Adverse selection is only possible in the context of asymmetric information. Anything we can do to reduce information asymmetries (i.e. better data collection and vetting up front) will reduce the possibility of adverse selection. We&#x27;re working on this.</p><p>4. Adverse selection isn&#x27;t a problem limited to institutional buyers like ourselves. Any time someone makes an offer on a home, and that offer is accepted, the buyer risks adverse selection. See for instance the &quot;winner&#x27;s curse.&quot; We can do better than the average buyer at solving this problem so long as we are better at information collection and valuation.</p><p>5. Lastly, the main economic prediction of adverse selection is that buyers will take adverse selection risk into account by bidding low, which means that a certain amount of otherwise mutually beneficial trade will fail to occur because buyers bid below their true valuations. To the extent we can reduce information asymmetries and help solve adverse selection, we can truly be a market maker by enabling additional mutual beneficial trade than would happen without us.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13164255,"story_id":13164026,"children":[]},{"id":13164269,"created_at_i":1481600817,"type":"comment","author":"jdross","text":"<p>Across thousands of homes, we have a pretty good sense of the costs here.

We have two data ingestion pipelines. One that we ingest immediately, and a second for our larger customers which is throttled during the day and ingested at night. For the throttled pipeline, we initially had hard coded rate limits, but as we made changes to our infrastructure, the throttle was processing a different amount than it should have been. Sometimes it would process too much, and we would start to see latency build up in our normal pipeline, and other times it processed too little.  For a short period of time, we had the hard coded throttle with a Slack command to override the default. This allowed an enginneer to change the rate limit if they saw we were ingesting to little or too much. While this worked, it was common that an engineer wasn&#x27;t paying attention, and we would process the wrong amount for a period of time. One of my coworkers used extremely basic reinforcement learning to make the throttle dynamic. It looks at the latency of the normal ingestion pipeline, and based on that, decides how high to set the rate limit on the throttled pipeline. Thanks to him, the throttle will automatically process as much as it can, and no one needs to watch it.</p><p>The same coworker also used decision trees to analyze query performance. He trained a decision tree on the words contained in the raw SQL query and the query plan. Anyone could then read the decision tree to understand what properties of a query made that query slow. There&#x27;s been times we&#x27;re we&#x27;ve noticed some queries having odd behavior going on, such as some queries having unusually high planning time.

Imagine something like Active Directory Federation Services, which stores its configuration in a database (SQL Server) and offers a good API for altering configuration data (Microsoft.Adfs.PowerShell).  Instead of using a generic configuration file template---something supported by just about every configuration management system, using a wide variety of templating mechanims---I must instead write a custom interface between the configuration management system and the AD FS configuration management API.  Contrast that with Shibboleth, which stores its configuration in a small collection of XML files (i.e., still strongly typed configuration data).  These I can manage relatively easily using my configuration management system&#x27;s existing file templating mechanism---no special adapter required.  I can easily keep a log of all changes by storing these XML files in Git.  I can put human-readable comments into them using the XML comment syntax.  The same goes for configuration files that use Java properties or JSON or YAML or even ini-style syntax, not to mention all the apps that have configuration files that amount to executable code loaded directly into the run-time environment (e.g., amavisd-new&#x27;s config file is Perl code, SimpleSAMLphp&#x27;s is PHP, portmaster&#x27;s is Bourne shell, portupgrade&#x27;s is Ruby, and so forth).</p><p>In short, your configuration database scheme is like an executable, whereas text config files are like source code (literally, in some cases).

But this structure is not necessarily good for explaining how to use the program; it may be irrelevant and confusing for a user.</p><p>Instead, the right way to structure documentation is according to the concepts and questions that a user will have in mind when reading it. This principle applies at every level, from the lowest (ordering sentences in a paragraph) to the highest (ordering of chapter topics within the manual). Sometimes this structure of ideas matches the structure of the implementation of the software being documented--but often they are different. An important part of learning to write good documentation is to learn to notice when you have unthinkingly structured the documentation like the implementation, stop yourself, and look for better alternatives.</p><p>[…]</p><p>In general, a GNU manual should serve both as tutorial and reference. It should be set up for convenient access to each topic through Info, and for reading straight through (appendixes aside). A GNU manual should give a good introduction to a beginner reading through from the start, and should also provide all the details that hackers want. […]</p><p>That is not as hard as it first sounds. Arrange each chapter as a logical breakdown of its topic, but order the sections, and write their text, so that reading the chapter straight through makes sense.

Do you know of any case where it has worked? From the way the article was written I was sort of expecting to hear a case study.</p><p>Speculation roundup:</p><p>There are two economic values of a homeless person, actually any person, but I digress. P is the cost, to the state, of keeping that person alive and medically stable, which includes police and health services, as well as shelter costs, soup kitchens, etc. V is the value generated by the homeless person through their labor, which varies much more than some people expect. Many homeless people have jobs. But for many homeless people it&#x27;s zero.</p><p>Ways of decreasing P include a number of creative policies designed recently as well as &quot;short-term&quot; tolerance of outdoor living. Ways of increasing V by contrast are generally limited to:</p><p>* standard inpatient mental health &quot;treatment&quot;, has a slim chance of success and a large chance of backfiring and setting V to zero for a long time, also sends P through the roof</p><p>* outpatient medication, has a similarly tiny chance of success but a smaller chance of backfiring and is much cheaper</p><p>* prison labor, effective but brings to mind immediately <i>The Road to Serfdom</i> and other dystopian fictions (heh)</p><p>* ???</p><p>Creative ways of increasing V ought to depend on economic fundamentals, i.e. finding out what a homeless person is good for and exploiting that, to wit: homeless people tend to beat normal people at dealing with homeless people. They might also be able to help out with e.g. trash pickup or road maintenance. The typical road-map people envision for increasing V looks like this:</p><p>homeless -&gt; [treatment] -&gt; normal</p><p>but in reality looks more like this:</p><p>very low V -&gt; [treatment] -&gt; low V -&gt; [more treatment] -&gt; slightly low V -&gt; [more treatment] -&gt; mediocre V -&gt; [more treatment] -&gt; with luck normal V</p><p>The typical way of dealing with the intermediate stages currently consists of either locking them in a small compound with shitty beds and twelve other crazy people or giving them a bottle of pills and hoping Jesus can handle the rest. This, really, is the problem. Halfway housing for homeless people might look like a situation where housing is provided in return for part-time labor.</p><p>I&#x27;d also like to point out that while in &quot;treatment&quot; for homelessness it might not be reasonable to demand <i>complete</i> sobriety when you consider that you&#x27;re preparing them for eventual release into a world where they&#x27;ll be allowed to drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes and probably marijuana and their drug use will not be so heavily monitored.

There were no logs of my activity, and nobody came to ask why in the world I was doing something like this.</p><p>-At another place, they were saving credit cards, encrypted, but their idea of saving encryption keys was to put them in a file that only root could access. Well, everyone had access to create batch jobs (yes, even phone reps), and batch jobs ran as root, so anyone could walk out with the lot. I had to do a lot of work to convince them that yes, this was not PCI compliant.</p><p>-Another system had relatively well protected data, only available to people with access. Except they had single sign on, and some of they systems that took credentials did so in the clear. Peek at network traffic, steal credentials, and then do whatever you want as anyone you want! They had a process where you were never supposed to leave your computer unattended, and if you did, team members would go into your computer and send an email to the team promising cake, and you&#x27;d have to bring it as punishment for your security problems. Imagine their surprise when people were sending emails promising cake while they were using their computers.</p><p>-A phone company having cell call metadata in the clear, in a DB any developer could query. There was another system with billing information, equally accessible. So search for your favorite person in one, and go to the other and see who they call, when they call, and from where. Isn&#x27;t that convenient?</p><p>So I don&#x27;t believe anyone&#x27;s claims about their data security unless they come from someone that has some security knowledge and has tried to evaluate the security pretending to be a real attacker. And even in that case, I&#x27;ll probably want a team of them. Otherwise, I&#x27;ll assume there are major flaws that nobody has found, just because nobody has cared enough.

(something I don&#x27;t want or need for a small home set up)</p><p>Last year I bought my wife and I our first set of &quot;smart&quot; phones. Yes I&#x27;m serious, I&#x27;ve been in IT all my life but never felt I had a need for anything other than a flip phone. But I noticed Samsung selling a Galaxy Core Prime for $90 and I bought my wife the LG Stylo for $180 since I wanted her to have a better camera.</p><p>For my home network, my modem runs into a linux box with Shorewall where it is natted&#x2F;firewalled and split into two subnets.</p><p>I&#x27;ve been a fan of the netgear prosafe access points for the last 10 years, as I could always find older models on ebay for cheap.</p><p>Currently I was using a WN203  (2x2 802n). For the most part it was just my laptop and a Roku box connected. never had problems. But enter in these new smart phones...</p><p>Within a few weeks (of buying the phones) I noticed random times of terrible wifi lag. Looking at the AP&#x27;s management webpage, I noticed during these random times of lag, my wife&#x27;s phone would be connected at just 1M. I&#x27;d tell her to restart her phone and the problem would go away for a day or two. But it kept happening. I wasn&#x27;t sure what the problem was but I used it as an excuse to get another access point, I was wanting one that had 5ghz anyway. I sniped a netgear WNDAP660 (3x3 802n) off of ebay, new in box for $95. They are normally $350 new. Figured that would solve my problems.</p><p>To my horror after a few days of having the new WNDAP660 set up, I started getting the same terrible lag and my wife&#x27;s phone would be connected at 1M again. This time though the WNDAP660, through the web interface had an option to save wifi traffic packets. During the next time of lag, I saved a few minutes of packet captures and opened them in wireshark.</p><p>I was surprised to see that even though my wife&#x27;s phone was connected at 1M, it was not the issue. My phone (the Core Prime) was spamming pwr_mgt request packets, 100&#x27;s per second. It was basically using up all the bandwidth. In disgust, I moved everything to the 5ghz band (gave it a different id), and left only my phone on the 2.4ghz. So all was well....</p><p>But that was just a couple of months ago. I&#x27;ve since out grown my core prime (which doesn&#x27;t take much) and bought a Galaxy S6. I turned off the 2.4ghz band on the AP, and now everything (including my new S6) are all connected to 5ghz.</p><p>And then you guessed it... I was sitting at the kitchen table and noticed lag while trying to browse the net on my laptop. I looked up and noticed the Roku box playing on TV was also stuck loading. I reached over and picked up my new S6 and put it into airplane mode. Instantly all was well on the airwaves. I haven&#x27;t actually done a packet dump yet, so I don&#x27;t know if the S6 is spamming pwr mgt requests or not.</p><p>But this is really annoying. I don&#x27;t know what is at fault either. It seems smart phones don&#x27;t play nice. But I&#x27;ve also caught my Roku box spewing RTS requests, even after rebooting it. I thought it had been hacked or something and  was trying to dos me, but after restarting one of the cell phones all went back to normal. Its as if certain devices don&#x27;t play well with each other. I mean, in my original lag case, the core prime was spamming packets, yet restarting my wifes phone would solve the problem just as good as restarting my phone. Makes no sense....</p><p>So I guess if you get random lag on wifi, try turning off a cell phone or two until you find the culprit. And once you find it, then.... Well actually I don&#x27;t know what you do then.

I said this yesterday in another Ubiquiti focused comment, but 1) ZHO forces all AP into the same L2 network and 2) ZHO puts all AP on the same channel and SSID.  The last one should be blatant enough for anyone to know that that&#x27;s not going to scale or be performant.  ZHO was implemented for old, low bandwidth devices that needed to be on the same network.  Full stop.  Don&#x27;t use ZHO!</p><p>Beyond that do some due diligence when setting up your networks.  Even with 802.11n&#x2F;ac in the 5GHz range you should be aware of best spectrum usage, about things like DFS and consider how wide of a band you&#x27;re allocating to the channel selection your making (hint: it impacts overlap).  Do not do not do not use auto channel selection unless you&#x27;re forced to.  I get it, you may not have control over this in a dense environment (apartment) but if you can control your airspace (reasonably so) map out channel utilization especially if you have more than one AP.  Then go to the next step and figure out the worse spots for reception in your house are and, as the person above me states, tune RSSI down to get clients to get kicked as they &quot;roam&quot;.  This will force them to reselect much faster.  One comment stated 8 second reassociations.  That&#x27;s just bad tuning and clear ignorance to the problem - you&#x27;d have the same thing with any other vendor.</p><p>This wasn&#x27;t hard to find and there are many others, use it: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;securityuncorked.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;11&#x2F;the-best-damn-802-11ac-channel-allocation-graphics&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;securityuncorked.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;11&#x2F;the-best-damn-802-11ac-c...</a></p><p>I think Ubiquiti makes some really great products for the price.  Have they violated GPL?  Quite possibly but as others have said  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s been proven judicially as of yet.  You will get one of the best products at this price point though and, when setup correctly, will be much more performance than things like Eero or Google Wifi that relies on wireless as the backhaul between APs.  If you&#x27;re saying you can&#x27;t use cabled infrastructure there are options.  1) Powerline is now &quot;decent&quot; as in 400-700 Mbit are attainable depending on your situation, they&#x27;re also much cheaper (look for HomePlug AV2 standardization) now 2) Dedicated, directional focused wireless backhaul is the better option than an omni backhaul between something that is already handling your clients.  That is Ubiquiti&#x27;s forte.  They only recently released the UniFi product but you can use NanoBeam, Bullet or NanoStation in your home to move things around to dedicated AP.</p><p>Ultimately if you want good wifi you have to pay for it and plan and deploy it correctly.  The second half of it is why we have Eero and Google Wifi - because people don&#x27;t do that.  They buy Ubiquiti or some other enterprise focused WLAN solution, plug it in and do the minimal work and say it doesn&#x27;t work or sucks without RTFM.</p><p>Finally if you want &quot;fast roaming&quot; you should know what you want before buying a product since the device OS needs to support it.  Apple has basically said they&#x27;re supporting 802.11r: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;HT202628\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;HT202628</a>.

Think of it this way - having one client on your WLAN that has a weak connection will introduce errors and retransmission impacting every client to a certain extent (it&#x27;s a shared medium).  In a deployment wherin you have multiple AP working together (on different channels) there&#x27;s going to be overlap so you have a continuation of service.  You may move around and be connected to WAP-B with an RSSI of -70 but be closer to WAP-A with an RSSI of -50.  Your OS will try to hang on to that connection as long as it can by default since it&#x27;s not scanning in the background for something better on a differing BSSID (the BSSID is the MAC, generally in a multi-AP environment you&#x27;ll have a singular SSID and each AP has a unique BSSID).</p><p>With minimum RSSI implementations the AP will kick (deauth) clients that no longer meet the minimum RSSI level.  This will force them to reconnect to and will go with the stronger BSSID being advertised with the same SSID.  Still rudimentary but works rather well.

I use them as remote office VPN tunnel routers, set them up for L2TP so I can do remote support, use packet mangling&#x2F;traffic shaping for VOIP. All this on a $100 router.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13164883,"story_id":13164263,"children":[]},{"id":13165236,"created_at_i":1481615088,"type":"comment","author":"lobster_johnson","text":"<p>I have a Mikrotik HAP AClite.

Things are definitely better than stock firmware.</p><p>The approach I took:</p><p>- When you&#x27;re new to DD-WRT, look up your router in the  database on their website. Take some time to read about installation (and maybe configuration) on their wiki. I never bricked any routers, but I can imagine taking it one step at a time prevents some headaches. Using their website search will lead you to builds which are a few years old (might differ for newer routers). I installed those initially. It might not be a bad idea to start with those as they probably match the documentation.</p><p>- But, you can also update with newer beta versions. They gave me the same stability and performance. You&#x27;ll get more options and a nicer interface, but presumably also security fixes. Find those through their FTP [0]. Be sure to read which exact build you need in the wiki.</p><p>So all in all a bit rough, but worth the effort.

You can completely deconstruct your application into components and encapsulate logic and responsibility, giving you all the tools you need for great architecture. I am traditionally more of a backend guy, but Polymer makes building frontend projects fun for me, because the most interesting thing about programming to me is software architecture, creating powerful abstractions and designing interaction and APIs.</p><p>I have been working with Polymer since the first beta release (before 0.1) and completed multiple projects, both at work and during my free time. It has not been without it&#x27;s problems. I have to say that it takes quite a while before it really &#x27;clicked&#x27;, because you have to learn quite a few patterns to make things work. If you started early on, it was very unpolished (despite that, we have a fairly large Polymer 0.5 application running in production, and it&#x27;s still chugging along nicely), and the upgrade process is extremely painful (hence aforementioned application still running 0.5). It can also be dangerous, because if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, it is easy to end up with some frankenstein contraption that performs terribly, and is a horror to maintain. My advice to anyone looking to get into Polymer is to get advice from more seasoned developers, the Slack channel[1] is a great resource for that. Learn from existing projects and applications as much as possible to see how they solve the issues you will run into, and get a feeling for how the general architectural patterns work.</p><p>The good part is that all the techniques you learn are almost directly applicable to the future native Web Platform, as one of the core concepts of Polymer is that it tries to emulate what the future Web Platform will look like, and allow you to use that platform today. Quite a large part of the platform is already natively supported on most of the evergreen browsers, and I find that I use less and less Polymer code these days and use more and more plain native code. One day we may no longer use Polymer at all, but your newly learned skills will still apply.</p><p>A recent side project of mine has been an exploration of what future Web Applications might look like, and to test what is possible on the platform today. I built it completely from scratch, with no libraries or dependencies other than Polymer:</p><p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;overwebs.ruph.in\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;overwebs.ruph.in</a> (warning: sound and relatively high bandwidth.

The job doesn&#x27;t matter as much when you&#x27;re dirt poor as long as it&#x27;s making money, and the risk of job loss is what you&#x27;re describing as loyalty.

This may be anecdotal, but I left home earlier than I should have and worked my fair share of &quot;blue collar&quot; jobs as a result and in none of these jobs were there people enjoying the present moment or describing any sense of loyalty to their jobs. They all hated their lives, hated their bosses and hated their jobs. Many could probably fit the description of a borderline alcoholic because that was the coping mechanism: Work all week, 9 to 5, then cut loose on the weekends until sloppy drunk and forget that you had to wake up and do it all over again Monday. And yet they were all &quot;hard workers&quot; with what may be described as a good work ethic. They cared because they had to...they needed the job and for them, anything better was a pipe dream. People in this position will literally fight each other for just a few extra hours of work...work that&#x27;s shit and barely pays for a cup of coffee per hour. When you have the luxury of quitting, a strong work ethic should be valued higher because it shows an employee that genuinely takes pride in what they do. But when your life literally hangs in the balance of an extra shift a strong work ethic becomes instantly more selfish and less of an objective measurement of someone&#x27;s capacity and instead is just a modern statistic on how far someone will go to survive. Most of these people are not noble altruists; they just lost their ambition when they realized their childhood dreams could never be accomplished and they&#x27;ve made the best of the situation.

We specialize in training engineers on front-end web development, specifically React, Redux, RxJS, and related technologies. We&#x27;ve trained engineers from Twilio, OpenTable, NerdWallet, Tesla, Esurance, and many more. We are based in SF.</p><p>Since we also do private consulting and project-based work in addition to our workshops, we have recently got to talking with our clients about helping them get full-time employment. So I think this post is pretty timely and very relevant to us. Here are a few reasons why we think React is important for the job market.</p><p>Lots of companies are choosing React for their front-end these days. It allows your front-end devs to embrace the full power of JavaScript for the front-end -- no more messing around with jQuery and tons of plugins. Sure, there&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve, like all new things. But there is now a large and devoted community to React and it&#x27;s only growing. A personal friend of mine convinced his boss to greenfield their entire app with 10,000 lines of jQuery, and rewrite it entirely in React. He was a new hire (and also a great communicator&#x2F;salesman).</p><p>Coding bootcamps are embracing React as well. Since most of these institutions survive year-to-year based on how well their placement numbers are for graduates, they are paying close attention to the trends in development. One could argue that since they are probably more technical than the average recruiter, they may even have a better grip of the pulse. FullStack Academy, of New York and Chicago, recently wrote a blog on why they&#x27;re moving their curriculum from Angular to React (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstackacademy.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;angular-to-react-fullstack-academy-updates-its-curriculum\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fullstackacademy.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;angular-to-react-fulls...</a>). App Academy (SF &amp; NYC) has had React in its curriculum for a number of months (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appacademy.io&#x2F;immersive&#x2F;curriculum\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appacademy.io&#x2F;immersive&#x2F;curriculum</a>). And I&#x27;ve personally spoken with alumni of Hack Reactor in SF who said that most students built their capstone project in React (or attempted to).</p><p>Is React the best solution? That&#x27;s arguable, as all things are. It also depends on what you want to accomplish. But for the relevancy of this post -- asking what tech skills people will be hiring for in 2017 -- I would argue that React is going to be one of the top skills. And with that includes...</p><p>Redux\nWebpack\nImmutable\nRxJS</p><p>As far as backend, the top three technologies that we&#x27;ve seen with our clients are:</p><p>Python\nGo\nDocker</p><p>But of course, all of this is moot without the foundation of strong JavaScript skills. Our students who have strong JS skills pick up React quickly -- those who don&#x27;t only get confused.</p><p>Anyways, if you are skilled in React and other related technologies and you are looking for work, you can always email me: ben at realworldreact dot com with some info about yourself and&#x2F;or your resume.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13163367,"story_id":13163367,"children":[{"id":13167091,"created_at_i":1481640284,"type":"comment","author":"xor1","text":"<p>Do you have any recommendations for picking up strong Javascript foundations?
