The provision for defense must in this, as in all other cases, be made commensurate to the danger of attack. Ambition must be made to counteract ambition. The interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place. It may be a reflection on human nature, that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government. But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.&quot;</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13162298,"story_id":13161155,"children":[]},{"id":13163040,"created_at_i":1481584966,"type":"comment","author":"SerpentJoe","text":"<p>Possibly because they won&#x27;t be doing it, or at least not going so far as to unconstitutionally refuse to hold hearings on Supreme Court replacements.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13162298,"story_id":13161155,"children":[{"id":13165013,"created_at_i":1481611218,"type":"comment","author":"bmelton","text":"<p>On what grounds do you find a refusal to consent to an executive&#x27;s appointment to be unconstitutional?

In many ways, he anticipated the efficiency studies of engineer Frederick Winslow Taylor. Regarding each plant as infinitely perfectible, he created an atmosphere of ceaseless improvement. Paradoxically, the mammoth scale of operations encouraged close attention to minute detail, for a penny saved in one place might then be multiplied a thousandfold throughout the empire. In the early 1870s, Rockefeller inspected a Standard plant in New York City that filled and sealed five-gallon tin cans of kerosene for export. After watching a machine solder caps to the cans, he asked the resident expert: “How many drops of solder do you use on each can?” “Forty,” the man replied. “Have you ever tried thirty-eight?” Rockefeller asked. “No? Would you mind having some sealed with thirty-eight and let me know?”34 When thirty-eight drops were applied, a small percentage of cans leaked—but none at thirty-nine. Hence, thirty-nine drops of solder became the new standard instituted at all Standard Oil refineries. “That one drop of solder,” said Rockefeller, still smiling in retirement, “saved $2,500 the first year; but the export business kept on increasing after that and doubled, quadrupled—became immensely greater than it was then; and the saving has gone steadily along, one drop on each can, and has amounted since to many hundreds of thousands of dollars.”</p><p>Rockefeller performed many similar feats, fractionally reducing the length of staves or the width of iron hoops without weakening a barrel’s strength[...]</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13161155,"story_id":13161155,"children":[{"id":13164078,"created_at_i":1481597734,"type":"comment","author":"pekk","text":"<p>A hero of micromanagement!</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13162642,"story_id":13161155,"children":[]},{"id":13162809,"created_at_i":1481583148,"type":"comment","author":"hackuser","text":"<p>Interesting story; thanks.

The thing is that no one needs to &quot;learn the whole org mode&quot;; you take it in piece by piece, based on the features you need. I started off learning just the (1) org markup syntax, and exporting. You write once, and then export the same to HTML, PDF, markdown, plain ASCII text, etc. Then I learned (2) Org capture.. taking notes at whim of a moment, dumping all notes in a single file (you don&#x27;t have to do it in a single file) categorized by tags. Then I wanted to take notes with &quot;living code&quot;.. notes that contain the code as well as the code output. So that was learning (3) Org babel. Then I wanted the notes to generate files containing the code in those notes. Enter (4) Org tangle. One day I felt like why not experiment with (5) Org table that is plain text spreadsheet that can contain formulas too. It truly is a beautiful piece of software. At some point, I started tinkering with elisp, and started appreciating the org mode design even more. I felt a need to have some thing like the default ASCII exporter, but few of my own tweaks. (6) And I learnt how to design my own custom org exporter.</p><p>And I believe that all of that is probably less than 50% of the whole of org mode. I will learn more as and when I feel the need.

You have commands (delete, copy, make uppercase,...), and a number of movements (right, down, to the next occurrence of a word, to line 27,...) or objects (word, line, paragraph, html tag, text within quotes, ...) to work on. These can be combined in any way you like, any command can be applied to any movement or object. So if you have a plugin like vim-angry that adds a &quot;C-style function parameter&quot; text object, all the commands you know can be applied to that. In contrast, in emacs, you have a number of commands (kill-line, kill-word, ...), and that&#x27;s it. You have to get by with those. If they didn&#x27;t implement the command you&#x27;d like to use, tough luck.</p><p>A second (minor) reason for me is that I work in the embedded software world, and usually on an embedded linux, there&#x27;s at least some variant of vim or vi available, while emacs is very rare.</p><p>Take my advice with a grain of salt : I&#x27;ve never really used emacs, so I can&#x27;t compare from first hand. From what I&#x27;ve heard, emacs is also a very good editor. To me, the question &quot;should I use vim or emacs&quot; is more or less the same as &quot;should I use firefox or chrome&quot; - I&#x27;m a chrome guy myself, but I don&#x27;t consider firefox to be crap, nor its users to be idiots. Internet explorer on the other hand,...</p><p>So my advice : learn vim. And if you don&#x27;t, learn emacs. Just learn to use either one properly, and you&#x27;ll be way faster at editing than people who don&#x27;t use those.</p><p>[0] a.o. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@mkozlows&#x2F;why-atom-cant-replace-vim-433852f4b4d1#.ot06wyos5\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@mkozlows&#x2F;why-atom-cant-replace-vim-43385...</a></p>","points":null,"parent_id":13158375,"story_id":13157497,"children":[{"id":13159009,"created_at_i":1481558657,"type":"comment","author":"omaranto","text":"<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m convinced by the composability argument. Isn&#x27;t composable the default for text editors? Emacs (and most text editors) let you select a portion of text (Emacs calls this marking a region) and then decide what to do with it: delete it, cut it (Emacs calls this killing), convert to upper case, etc. Vim mostly uses the other order: Commands first, motion or text object later (except in visual mode where it&#x27;s like other editors: Select something first,  command later).</p><p>So you just need to implement a bunch of selection commands to get Vim-style composability. I think lots of these modern text editors like sublime or atom come with select word, select parenthesized expression, select paragraph, etc. If the editor is extensible you can define new selection commands and compose them with the existing commands that operate on a region, just like Vim. Emacs certainly has a bunch of marking commands.</p><p>The extra commands you mentioned in Emacs (kill-word, kill-line, etc.) are just for convenience: Shortcuts for common cases. In Vim you can delete to the end of the word with dw. In Emacs you could also do a 2 keystroke solution: do mark-word, delete-region (you could use backspace, Control D or delete for that second second thing since they &quot;operate on the region of the selection is active&quot;, so C-@ &lt;backspace&gt; would do it).

My gut feeling tells me that vim will still have more &quot;targets&quot; for a command, and more accurate ones, but I&#x27;m biased.</p><p>But the &quot;select text and then apply command&quot;, as I understand it, still has a major drawback compared to vim&#x27;s way of working : the dot-command. In vim, you go &quot;daa&quot; (delete an argument - i.e. delete the argument, including the comma which separates it, if you have the vim-angry plugin).

Textadept doesn&#x27;t offer counts, I believe. I think counts are probably an advantage of Vim and Emacs over most(?) other editors.</p><p>3. About Vim having more motions &amp; text objects: Probably, but Emacs is close. Without extra packages you have: words, symbols and S-expressions (the names come from Lisp but these do something sensible in most languages: Symbol is usually identifier and S-expression is something like delimited expression: A string, a parenthesized expression, a block in curly braces or brackets, etc.), lines,  sentences, and paragraphs. Texts packages add other targets like LaTeX environment. One thing definitely lacking in Emacs is that Vim usually offers two variants that differ slightly at the ends (like w vs e, or i( vs a(), those minor variations are pretty useful.</p><p>My point is just the saying other editors don&#x27;t have the ability to combine commands with different things to operate on is obviously false, and claiming is unlikely to convert anytime to Vim.

What I was saying is that it is not unique to Vim. Vim uses &quot;command; motion-or-textobject&quot; in normal mode where most editors use &quot;select-what-you-want; command&quot; (which is what Vim does in visual mode). If your editor has a good stock of selection commands (some have select word, line, paragraph, parenthesized expression, etc. -- I don&#x27;t use atom but Emacs and Textadept have all those and more, like select LaTeX environment) and a good stock of commands that operate on the selection (like delete, cut, wrap in parenthesis, uppercase, etc.), I&#x27;d say you have composable editing.</p><p>I don&#x27;t think the link you have addresses my point at all.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13160095,"story_id":13157497,"children":[{"id":13163680,"created_at_i":1481591757,"type":"comment","author":"alwillis","text":"<p>It seems pretty clear to me that it does indeed address your point.</p><p>That you can build up sophisticated actions just by knowing the primitives and text objects is the point, right? And not having to memorize different commands and different selections.</p><p>From the article:</p><p><i>But now let’s look at delete commands. Let’s say you want to delete a word, delete to the end of the line, delete to the end of the file, or delete to the end of a paragraph.\nEmacs only has two of these functions: kill-word and kill-line. Atom has the same two, more or less: deleteToEndOfWord() and deleteLine().</p><p>Vim, though, is different. Vim only has one command: d, which is “delete.” What does it delete? You name it, literally. The d command gets combined together with those commands for movement: dw deletes to the next word, d$ to the end of the line, dG to the end of the file, and d} to the end of the paragraph.</p><p>This is where Vim’s composability leads to its power. Emacs and Atom don’t have commands for deleting to the end of a file or a paragraph — even when they have commands to move to those places. But in Vim, if you can move to a location, you can delete to that location.</p><p>And composability is about more than just power, it’s also about learnability and consistency. The command for copying text in Vim is y. Do you know how to copy to the end of the line&#x2F;file&#x2F;paragraph? Of course you do: It’s y$, yG, and y} respectively. The command for increasing the indent is &gt;, so you instantly know &gt;$, &gt;G, and &gt;}.

They tend to be called mark-something. There are commands for selecting words, sentences, paragraphs, function definitions, S-expressions (the name comes from Lisp but they&#x27;re defined to be something useful in every language, usually something like &quot;any delimited construct in the language --strings, blocks, array literals, etc.&quot;). Once you select something you can apply many actions to it: you can delete it, uppercase it, rot13 it, sort the lines in it, wrap it in parenthesis, etc.</p><p>Maybe what tripped the author up is that additionally Emacs has other commands like kill-word, kill-line that are shortcuts for common combinations of a motion and a command. The author is correct in saying that these convenience commands are not composable, but they&#x27;re nice shortcuts to have (and by the way, contrary to what the author says Emacs does have a kill-paragraph command).</p><p>So you to delete a word you can do:</p><p>Vim: dw</p><p>Emacs composable style: M-@ C-D (that is, mark-word delete-\nregion[^1])</p><p>Emacs shortcut: M-D (kill-word)</p><p>Atom composable style: Option-Shift-f backspace</p><p>Atom shortcut: Option-d</p><p>(I got the Atom ones by Googling, I don&#x27;t if they are right, but if they&#x27;re not, I&#x27;m pretty sure correct ones exist: Atom has both a composable way and a shortcut.)</p><p>Vim propaganda should stop saying other editors lack composable commands. Even notepad.exe lets me use any of its paltry motion commands[^2] available to select something and then use a generic delete command to delete whatever I selected. &quot;Composability&quot; is the default mode of operation of most text editors.</p><p>Vim propaganda should focus instead on the very real advantages than Vim&#x27;s command model has. For example:</p><p>- dot repeats the whole command&#x2F;motion pair. This is fabulous!</p><p>- Vim has counts so you can delete 9 words just as easily as 3 words. (Emacs also has them, but lots of editors don&#x27;t, and they&#x27;re superhandy.)</p><p>- Vim has lots of little variations of the motions and textobjects so you can pick exactly what you need, other editors tend to have fewer. For example, for words, Vim has w, e, aw, iw (and probably others I&#x27;m forgetting) which are related but a little bit different.</p><p>(Also, personally I think Vim bloggers should recognize that those non-composable commands like kill-word are nice optional shortcuts, that are actually a tiny advantage other editors have over Vim.

For example, AucTeX has a command to mark a LaTeX environment, but it also should have what Vim would call &quot;inner LaTeX environment&quot;. As a more basic example, I wrote my own mark-line command because what I want to do with lines isn&#x27;t always kill them! With builtins I think the best way to mark 5 whole lines starting from the one you&#x27;re one is C-a C-SPC C-5 C-n, which is awful.

For that reason, and because HPC has traditionally been thought to need DP, IIRC no public roadmap mentioned Maxwell Tesla at all. Instead, the GK210 (K80) was the attempt to be the bridge-gap chip for HPC until Pascal; it was released just a few months before the big GM200 consumer chips came out. That is until fall &#x27;15 when the late arriving M40 and M4 were pitched as &quot;Deep learning accelerators&quot; (though GRID&#x2F;virtualization version were released a little earlier in August). Quite obvious naming, plus no sane HPC shop would buy a crippled (no DP) chip &lt;1 year before the promised miracle-chip, Pascal was planned to be released.  Let&#x27;s not forget that P100 was known to be quite late, K80 was insufficient for the needs of many customers, so another bridge-gap was necessary, and that what the M Teslas were: bridge-gap ML&#x2F;DL cards that Google&#x2F;FB&#x2F;Baidu and the like wanted, and picked up pretty quickly e.g. see [1].</p><p>&gt; As for the half precision, it&#x27;s pretty much the same thing NVIDIA been doing since Kepler dumping FP64 and FP16, especially FP16 due to the silicon costs.</p><p>Not really.

First, you need to separate the mechanism used to express voter preference (i.e the ballot design), from the method used to choose the winner. Those are separate things that, in theory, can be mixed-and-matched to produce various voting systems.</p><p>In terms of ballot designs, they are basically all just restricted subsets of the &quot;score&quot; voting ballot. That is, any voter preference that can be expressed in an &quot;approval&quot;, &quot;ranked choice&quot;, &quot;ranked choice with ties&quot;, or traditional &quot;single choice&quot; ballot, can also be expressed with a &quot;score&quot; ballot.</p><p>That means every voting system is a &quot;score ballot&quot; system with some restrictions applied to the ballot. This means that, for example, you could have an election where you allow the voter to choose whichever ballot they are most comfortable with. Then you just interpret the ballot as a score ballot.</p><p>There are multiple ways to choose a winner from a set of score ballots. But debating between them is counterproductive to getting better voting systems adopted. Just start off with one that&#x27;s easy to understand (i.e. &quot;sum of ratings&quot;, or &quot;only the first choice counts&quot;), and worry about improving it later.</p><p>The important thing is to give the voter the option to use a more expressive ballot. Whichever one they feel most comfortable with. You could even make it so that initially, all ballots are converted to traditional &quot;single choice&quot; ballots for tallying, but let voters know how the vote would have turned out under other evaluation methods (like &quot;sum of ratings&quot; and Schulze). I think voters would quickly realize the value of counting all of their expressed preferences.</p><p>...</p><p>But that is a very cool site.

You might need to start off with conversion to traditional &quot;single choice&quot;, because it&#x27;s hard to argue against adopting it. That is, you&#x27;re not actually changing the election system at all. You&#x27;re just allowing people to optionally express extra information about their preferences in a way that does not affect the election. But it will give each voter a chance to, if they want, try out more expressive ballots (which will presumably be appealing to most people once they get the hang of it), and the public will be told how the election would have resulted under the other two evaluation systems. Presumably, a more &quot;centrist&quot; candidate would generally have won. And after a few election cycles, people will be able to form an opinion on which evaluation system they think produces the best results.</p><p>I think the reason why electoral system change has so often been met with public resistance is that most people don&#x27;t have a feel for how the results would change, and nobody is offering them a chance to get familiar with a different election system without an up-front commitment to the change.</p><p>If you can get people to accept the &quot;sum of ratings&quot; evaluation method, then I say be happy with that. The fact that &quot;sum of ratings&quot; is arguably not as good as Schulze is a very high class problem to have. (Btw I&#x27;m using Schulze as a stand-in for any &quot;good but complex&quot; evaluation system.) Anyway, I&#x27;m not sure the improvement in evaluation is worth having an evaluation system that most people wouldn&#x27;t understand.</p><p>So just to sum up, I think what I&#x27;m proposing is different and more acceptable in that:</p><p>i) It allows people to use whichever ballot they feel most comfortable with, knowing that no matter which ballot they choose, their vote will count as much as any other voter.</p><p>ii) It allows voters, if they so choose, to get familiar with the more expressive ballots and different evaluation methods without committing to any change in the election system.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13163790,"story_id":13161396,"children":[]}]}]},{"id":13167874,"created_at_i":1481645730,"type":"comment","author":"hash-set","text":"<p>&quot; In 2011, almost a full quarter of young Americans said democracy was a &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;very bad&quot; way to run a country.

Now, Johnson&#x27;s policies are fairly fringe and weird, and so are the other third party candidate&#x27;s (Stein), but that&#x27;s because serious candidates don&#x27;t run on third party tickets that have no chance of winning.

Well, except that that would also fundamentally change the coverage of the race, so there&#x27;s no reason to expect the election would go anywhere near the same way overall (it would probably be less polarized), but the point is that to the limited extent the survey results reflect this hypothetical world, they don&#x27;t cast it in a bad light.</p><p>Edit: Also, I like Clinton, but her being the Concordet winner doesn&#x27;t mean much in terms of that world either.

Fuck &#x27;em, what&#x27;ll they do -- vote Republican? To make your preference unambiguous by an actual vote, under our system, you have to be seriously into the fringe. This creates a kind of activation-energy barrier to coordinating on a change: very many people can feel that, say, smoking pot is OK, without their preference mattering -- without it even affecting their vote. This fraction could even exceed 50%, unless it&#x27;s <i>common knowledge</i> that it&#x27;s over 50%: you don&#x27;t &quot;throw away&quot; your vote when you expect everyone else to also vote strategically according to preferences which aren&#x27;t common knowledge.</p><p>So a voting system with less of a strategy problem could make common knowledge of real voter preferences easier to arrive at -- the preferences people would honestly vote by, given the chance.
