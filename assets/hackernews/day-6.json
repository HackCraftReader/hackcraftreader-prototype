It is undoubtedly easier for companies to swallow a significant cash payout to an employee when they are receiving a large corresponding cash infusion resulting from sales of a developed idea. Following implementation of an efficiency improvement, understandably, as time passes companies tend to only see the current bottom line as the norm vice seeing &quot;what could have been&quot;.

Thus, any award based on annual projected savings will also need to factor in the diminished value as a result of uncertainty. Cost savings projections are non-deterministic.</p><p>I guess my point is that I think cost savings sharing is much more complex than a profit sharing, in which you simply take a cut of any profits (albeit a significantly smaller portion since the company is assuming the development&#x2F;commercialization risk) that roll through the door.</p><p>That said, I could see cost savings awards as a one-time award based on the agreed upon value at a given time, rather than an ongoing profit sharing program that pays out until the product is no longer profitable.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13144710,"story_id":13142327,"children":[]}]}]},{"id":13154173,"created_at_i":1481498994,"type":"comment","author":"stefek99","text":"<p>&quot;Most developers think that the work they do at work belongs to their employer, but anything they work on at home or on their own time is theirs.&quot;</p><p>NOT ME.</p><p>I dread the time when in order to pay my bills I had to sign a contract...</p><p>Released all my ideas to the public domain: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;genesisdotre&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ideas-released-to-public-domain-prior-to-signing-very-restrictive-employment-contract-(January-2014)#releasing-ip-before-it-is-too-late\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;genesisdotre&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ideas-released-to-...</a></p><p>&quot;original matter, work or creation&quot; - on my occasions I wanted to ask how about:\n1) cake recipes\n2) gardening\n3) drawing with my kids\n4) urine and excrements\n5) photography</p><p>(if I was to create YouTube channel talking about philosophy that would inevitably belong to them as well)</p><p>Can we please introduce employment contracts that are fair to both sides?</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13142327,"story_id":13142327,"children":[]},{"id":13142910,"created_at_i":1481327189,"type":"comment","author":"stevesun21","text":"<p>after i figured that he is CEO and cofounder of many famous startups, I feel bias in this article and I will make sure I will not work him in the future for sure :-)</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13142327,"story_id":13142327,"children":[{"id":13143735,"children":[]}]},{"id":13143935,"children":[]},{"id":13142912,"created_at_i":1481327193,"type":"comment","author":"rjurney","text":"<p>You ALL need to read California Labor Code 2870!</p><p>Surprised nobody has mentioned the most essential thing to know about regarding this stuff in California.

But actual actions in Companies Court are rare. If you were in need of stopping a rogue director in their actions, or others in acting upon rogue instructions, you would wan to rush down to Applications Court, with as much evidence as you can grab, the pertinent law for reference, and a draft &quot;without notice&quot; application to obtain a order immediately, not waiting for anyone to reply, not wasting time politely writing cease &amp; desist of other futile letters, and most likely unless you really are mistaken, you probably will get such a order to serve to stop rogue actions, with little or no delay. Such action is easily within the competence of most anyone here, to quickly prepare and present. You will find the Master Of Court, himself usually a senior judge, acting as a &quot;doorman&quot; or &quot;bouncer&quot; to prevent rubbish cases wasting the court&#x27;s time. The Master is exactly who can be willing to get your application in good order, something I know no remotely affordable solicitor can do, within the time necessary, or at all. The experience in court is infinitely less troubling or intimidating, than the real worries you likely are facing, time of your visit.

It&#x27;s really worth getting a chat with anyone there able to still give their time and not attached to a ACD headset, but in  real office, I wholeheartedly recommend inquiring beyond casual call center contact, if the moment offers itself to do so.</p><p>FWIW, my most rewarding, productive, and of all my experiences  the least every worried about money, collaboration in business, was with a family friend and henceforth, my friend, who sadly passed away unexpectedly and far too young, a decade ago. But my experience of &quot;doing business with a friend&quot; is almost unique, and we almost vied with one another competitively to be &quot;by the book&quot; and compliant with our duties to one another and company because of lousy earlier experiences. If anything, I think we raised that to the point of being a unnecessarily high cost, at least from our time. But it was absolutely a superb and indeed rare case of continuous trust building, which didn&#x27;t supplant other necessary trust creating behaviour, nor detract or affect life negatively in any way. (e.g. bothering too much about being &quot;above board&quot; never caused one of us to think the other was &quot;overdoing it much&quot; for the wrong reasons. I can merely hope I&#x27;ll have as good a experience again. But one huge positive legacy of all that exercise in transparency and proper discharge of our duties, really made me acutely aware of how I&#x27;ve just not met anyone since who I felt could meet my late partner&#x27;s standards.

At least the Act, alone. I&#x27;ve even enjoyed a very candid conversation at some length with the Registrar Of Companies, when the last major Act came into force, and she was incredibly helpful and illuminating, explaining the nuances of her statutory role and its offices. For guidance as to effect of Articles or Association, please do ask their Compliance office. Articles or Table A are the bylaws of a company, and many sharp operators will try to get Companies House to accept heavily modified articles, which contradict or attempt to restrict, statutory rights, roles or obligations. There was once a inactive registered company, names Silverstone blah blah management, about the time of a rumoured bid for control of the motor racing circuit. I pulled the Table A, and none to my surprise, almost every page of it was marked in the margin, alongside almost every paragraph, with a dot or a code, indicating Compliance was highly suspect of this document, as to its legality. But, as Compa ies House began to intone by reflex, I remember the information becoming a mantra when inquiring about almost anything, they are only a records office, not enforcers. The Registrar told me in addition, that that year sh had budget and allowance (I got the sense as if she felt it was a deliberately token allowance, arbitrarily set somehow and not under her budgetary power, to prosecute four directors each month, for technical breaches of the law. I had presented her office with a single director, for whom records tallied literally hundreds of summary offences.</p><p>Larger but less scrupulous or less publicly reported companies, flout the law routinely, a trivial cost of doing business. Small fly by nights and sham &quot;business partners&quot; you may encounter, may roll right over you, in a instant. You might be a director and have majority equity in common shares, but another director may (quite unlawfully, but see further) de-register you as a director, call a company meeting, if one is even required, dilute you to nothing, seek shareholder approval for consolidating fraudulent actions, like divesting working capital via special dividend, and banks will almost in every single case, do as they are told if the right forms are provided. You will sure have recourse under the Act, and many summary (not tried but assessed on the facts by a judge) offenses are criminal and even punishable by imprisonment, but you would be lost without a proper management contract and ideally a law firm of repute contracted as Company Secretary and that contract specifying detailed additional procedures, even clerical checks and notifications help here, and ultimately if thus sort of thing happens, you are in real trouble with little real recourse and no immediate remedy.</p><p>That&#x27;s a mere taste of the fun which can be English Limited Companies!</p><p>From memory, and it&#x27;s long since I undertook any comparative study, only Sweden has laws which truly make a manager &#x2F; managing director, responsible for their behaviour, under real penalty. Obviously, don&#x27;t take my word for it, but I was seeking answer to just this: &quot;So where can I risk turning my back one second, on a limited company I invest in?&quot;, and Sweden was the only jurisdiction which I felt satisfied me.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13144945,"story_id":13142327,"children":[]},{"id":13148036,"created_at_i":1481405521,"type":"comment","author":"bjelkeman-again","text":"<p>Which is one of the reasons my last effort is a not for profit.

We separate between three types of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs): High spontaneous rate (HSR), low spontaneous rate (LSR) and mid spontaneous rate (MSR). Basically the HSRs are our high gain fibers used for low sound levels. Their response saturates quite early. LSRs on the other hand are low gain fibers used for higher levels.</p><p>the ANF synapse can release a large amount of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft (in this case glutamate) the problem is that high concentrations of glutamate can are actually harmful and HSR fibers seem to be quite sensitive to these high concentrations. If there is a long term exposure to a noisy environment the high glutamate concentration might selectively kills your HSR fibers. The problem with this is that your threshold of hearing is still normal as there is no damage to the HSR fibers which you need to detect low level sounds so your audiogram looks perfectly fine. But you will start to get problems if you are in situations where you need your full dynamic range e.g. understanding speech in a noisy environments.</p><p>As you can see from my writing, this is a current subject of research so we do not know for sure but it seems like that you have to be quite careful with long time noise exposure even if the sound levels are below what is normally considered as harmful.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13140179,"story_id":13139978,"children":[{"id":13140981,"created_at_i":1481310567,"type":"comment","author":"Chico75","text":"<p>It sounds a lot like what I am experiencing too.

Here are a few that come to mind:</p><p>1.  A better system for automation and measurement.  Current solutions aren&#x27;t ideal when it comes to setting up new systems as well as updating and maintaining existing systems.  We build several million dollar facilities a month and each one has automation and measurement equipment that has to be individually set up and programmed.  Each technician does things a slightly different way, and the end result is a different set of automation and measurement logic at each facility.</p><p>2) Fiber optic DATS (distributed acoustic and temperature sensing) data handling and interpretation.  This is a fairly new type of technology in which a fiber optic line is installed in the wellbore.  The fiber optic line basically acts as a 15,000&#x27; strand of thermometers and microphones placed every 3&#x27;. The data from one installation is on the order of terabytes per hour.  Oil and gas service companies that offer this service don&#x27;t know how to handle this amount of data.  The problem could probably be solved with S3 or something.</p><p>3) Drilling optimization. Create a software suite that utilizes ML&#x2F;AI to help drilling engineers figure out the best way to drill a well is. It&#x27;s a perfect ML&#x2F;AI application. Lots and lots of training data available,  easily defined input and output parameters, etc. Drilling engineering is full of hard, non-linear problems and humans are just really bad at it.

Most files (patches, signatures) are composed of an uncompressed header, and a brotli-compressed stream (in the reference implementation, compression format are pluggable) of other messages.</p><p>- The main diff method is based on rsync. It&#x27;s slightly tuned, in that: it operates over the hashes of all files (which means rename tracking is seamless - the reference implementation detects that and handles it efficiently), and it takes into account partial blocks (at the end of files, smaller than the block size)</p><p>- The reference implementation is quite modular Go, which is nice for portability, and, like elisee mentioned, used in production at itch.io. We assume most things are streaming (so that, for example, you can apply a patch while downloading it, no temporary writes to disk needed), we actually use a virtual file system for all downloads and updates.</p><p>- The reference implementation contains support for block-based (4MB default) file delivery, which is useful for a verify&#x2F;heal process (figure out which parts are missing&#x2F;have been corrupted and correct them)</p><p>- The wharf repo contains the basis of a second diff method, based on rsync - for a secondary patch optimization step. The bsdiff algorithm is well-commented with references to the original paper, and there&#x27;s an opt-in parallel bsdiff codepath (as in multi-core suffix sorting, not just bsdiff operating on chunks)</p><p>- A few other companies (including well-known gaming actors) have started reaching out &#x2F; using parts of wharf for their own usage, I&#x27;ll happily name names as soon as it&#x27;s all become more public :)</p><p>I&#x27;d be happy to answer any questions!</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13141399,"story_id":13139638,"children":[{"id":13143087,"created_at_i":1481329236,"type":"comment","author":"scrollaway","text":"<p>That&#x27;s quite incredibly thorough.

The first file is a small standalone computer program called RegisterEvent.exe, which allows you to create your own registration files. So you won&#x27;t have to register with Douglass Associates and you won&#x27;t have to pay a registration fee. You can read more about RegisterEvent and how to use it below. The second file is a ZIP file containing all the source code for COMPMNGR and its supporting programs.

I have two main complaints about it:</p><p>1. The UX is subpar. It insists on running in only a single tab at a time, and attempts to open multiple tabs will instead override whatever it considers to be the master tab. This is a huge pain, because I often need to have a mapping workflow open in one window and some other relevant part of the application open in another. Instead I have to save, go find the thing I want, and go back. Another problem is that when working with data sources containing tons of fields, there&#x27;s no easy way to search.</p><p>2. It offers an expression language to perform some computational tasks, similar to what you&#x27;d find in Excel, but it&#x27;s hamstrung by a poor UI and a limited amount of functions. The built-in editor for expressions is really poor (see Tableau for an example of a great editor for a simple Excel-like language; it even has type linting) and, unless I&#x27;ve misunderstood something, you can&#x27;t declare any variables so you end up with huge nested expressions. There aren&#x27;t many functions available, so something as simple as removing whitespace ends up as lstrip(rstrip(foo)). In combination with no support for statements (or at least a let expression like in lisp) this makes any nontrivial data munging completely indecipherable.</p><p>I&#x27;ve looked around in this space and it seems like there are a variety of products, but the supplier of our main CRM will only support Informatica Cloud. I think that a company that can offer a product that does what you&#x27;ve said but makes a serious effort at UX could cause users to revolt and demand to use it! I know the joke is that Slack is just a pretty IRC with better UX... but that&#x27;s exactly why it has become so successful.</p><p>In terms of data munging, take a look at Microsoft&#x27;s Power BI. It&#x27;s visualization software but it has a nice data munging mode that, crucially, keeps track of all the changes you make and displays them in a linear format. This is great for getting a quick idea as to what was done with the data and is essential for doing reproducible data analyses. Unfortunately, Power BI also suffers from poor UX in insisting on tiny fonts and gray-on-gray palettes that are totally unreadable to anyone over 30.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13140352,"story_id":13139638,"children":[]},{"id":13140377,"children":[]},{"id":13140381,"created_at_i":1481306319,"type":"comment","author":"juskrey","text":"<p>Will hedge funds take such a huge risk of using 3rd party centralized (or centrally developed) data management system?</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13140352,"story_id":13139638,"children":[{"id":13140502,"created_at_i":1481307132,"type":"comment","author":"otoburb","text":"<p>Provided they can deploy the 3rd party solution onsite (aka &quot;on premise&quot;), this wouldn&#x27;t be seen as a &quot;huge risk&quot;.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13140381,"story_id":13139638,"children":[{"id":13140529,"created_at_i":1481307303,"type":"comment","author":"juskrey","text":"<p>And what about the risk of 3rd party dev error which will throw several funds at once out of the business?</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13140502,"story_id":13139638,"children":[{"id":13140706,"created_at_i":1481308489,"type":"comment","author":"otoburb","text":"<p>Great question, but I don&#x27;t see this much different from other industries or companies with millions or billions of dollars at stake.

Plus our fees are driven more by the market than by our actual costs, so if we billed fewer hours, we would simply bill at a higher rate to reach the same expected fee while still maintaining our position in the marketplace. Or if we could reduce our fee, we might be able to win more market share.</p><p>The pejorative term in the industry for padding billing with useless busy work is &quot;fee justification,&quot; which really shouldn&#x27;t ever be necessary. Especially in my practice area, because there&#x27;s always more work that can be done to flesh out our deliverables, which in turn makes them more effective for convincing the IRS (or state equivalent) or an appeals judge. When I say I&#x27;ve cut thousands of dollars of charge hours, we didn&#x27;t simply stop charging those hours, we allocated them to more useful, value added activities.</p><p>Right now, staff spend far too much time inefficiently manipulating data in Excel, manually organizing exhibits, and a variety of other mundane, low cognitive effort tasks (I can&#x27;t really specify what kinds because that would essentially doxx me). They feel productive, they look productive, and they meet their charge hour goals. And it allows them to procrastinate on the more mentally taxing work, like evaluating the relevant legal and technical tax issues, which in turn detracts from the quality of our service. Our clients aren&#x27;t paying us to be extra-expensive outsourced spreadsheet monkeys. They&#x27;re paying us to eliminate uncertainty about complicated legal and tax issues. So freeing up engagement budget and the staff&#x27;s mental bandwidth to focus on the high value added cognitive services is tremendously useful in improving quality.</p><p>And in terms of time, we compete on that in some cases where there&#x27;s an audit, exam, or appeal deadline and the client came to us late in the game.

If you can&#x27;t agree on that, then every time a new version comes out the web is split and the caching doesn&#x27;t work, and every time someone decides to use another CDN (or someone provides a new one) the group is split again.</p><p>But then split that across all the fonts, formats, and compression schemes available and you&#x27;ll see that the chance that a visitor has seen that font, at that version, from that CDN, using that compression scheme, in that format at any point in the past EVER is actually significantly smaller than you&#x27;d think.</p><p>Which brings us into the next point. Even if you&#x27;ve seen it before, the chances that you&#x27;ll have it cached is pretty small. Browser caches are suprisingly small in the grand scheme of things, and people tend to clear them more often than you think. Add in privacy browser mode and &quot;PC cleaner&quot; programs and the average person&#x27;s caches lasts much shorter than at least I expected it to.</p><p>But even worse are mobile caches. IIRC older android had something like a 4MB cache!!! And until very recently safari had something like a 50mb limit (and before that didn&#x27;t cache ANYTHING to disk!). Now it&#x27;s better, but you are still looking at a few hundred MB of cache. And with images getting bigger, big GIFs being common, huge amounts of AJAX requests happening all the time in most web pages, you&#x27;ll find that the browser cache is completely cycled through on a scale of days or hours not weeks or months.</p><p>IMO it&#x27;s at the point where the &quot;dream&quot; of using a CDN and having a large percentage of your users already have the item in their cache isn&#x27;t going to work out, and you are better off bundling stuff yourself and doing something like &quot;dead code elimination&quot; to get rid of anything you don&#x27;t use. And that method only becomes more powerful when you start looking at custom caching and updating solutions. A few months ago I saw a library that was designed to only download a delta of an asset and store it in localstorage so updates to the application code only need to download what changed and not the whole thing again.

My father used to work at some of these institutions. He&#x27;s a psychologist with a PhD and 20+ years of experience treating the mentally ill. His bosses, who are in charge of running the place and determining policy, had high school educations. The nursing staff, who spent most of the time with the patients, also had high school education (maybe some nursing school education, but usually not). I think we should increase funding for mental health clinics, and put the professionals in charge.</p><p>Also, I understand the aversion many people have to even the concept of asylums, but the problem is in the implementation, not the concept.

Authoritarian regimes don&#x27;t care about most individuals. This is about power structures in a society as a whole.

Every additional person you need in your secret police in order to maintain your power makes things harder, everything that a computer can just tell you makes it easier.</p><p>So, you have to think not from the standpoint of an individual and what someone could do to target you specifically (which usually is impractical to protect against, and is unnecessary in a stable social structure), but from the standpoint of someone trying to gain power over a large social structure (such as a dictator in a country--but really, it&#x27;s not in any way tied even to political positions, it might just as well be the head of a company trying to establish themselves as a de-facto monopoly, say), and what makes it easier for them to gain and to maintain power, and what hinders them, on the scale of the society as a whole. And you have to realize that a lot of this is path-dependent: It&#x27;s a lot harder to remove a dictator once they are in place than to prevent them.

A law doesn&#x27;t self-enforce. The mere existence of a law does not limit de-facto power. You can not limit an entity&#x27;s power by telling it that it is required to limit its own power. That might make exercising the power illegal, but it does not take away the actual power. And you don&#x27;t have to look particularly far back into history to see how governments don&#x27;t care about enforcing laws against themselves when that would limit their power. A lot of the things the NSA has been doing was illegal--did that stop them from doing it? No. As a matter of fact, they could eavesdrop on google&#x27;s fibers, so they did, whether legal or not.

If that answer doesn&#x27;t make much sense, please read on for the complex bits.</p><p>To provide some historical context, Linus gave a VERY public, VERY brutal rant on NVIDIA and their drivers four years ago.[0] At the time, NVIDIA&#x27;s closed drivers were an opaque blob which basically reimplemented the entirety of OpenGL. These collided with everything else.</p><p>The open drivers (nouveau) were slow and far behind in features. The situation was bad enough that you couldn&#x27;t necessarily even <i>install</i> a linux distro on a system with NVIDIA chip because the open drivers wouldn&#x27;t work well enough for X and&#x2F;or desktop environment to initialise properly, let alone remain up and functional.</p><p>In effect, if you wanted to run linux, you were best off <i>without</i> NVIDIA.</p><p>Fast forward year and a half. NVIDIA had come out and committed to improving the linux driver situation. They still couldn&#x27;t open source their current-generation drivers, but they had realised the horrible reputation of their hardware on linux was going to be a persistent PR nightmare, and thus an existential threat to their growing mobile division. A space where they were up against Imagination Technologies. (Don&#x27;t get me started on ImgTec, please...)</p><p>NVIDIA needed to get their hardware and software processes aligned in a way that <i>they would work reliably out of the box on linux</i>, everywhere. Even if the user only needed to keep the freshly installed or upgraded system up long enough for them to download and install the closed drivers, the system really should not break. Incidentally this meant that even the open drivers should be &quot;good enough&quot;.</p><p>Over the past 3+ years, the situation has improved. NVIDIA has managed to shed their reputation of being completely broken on linux, they have worked closely with kernel folks to get their more recent hardware supported sensibly out of the box and in the process (I believe) they have managed to reduce the code delta between their windows drivers and linux drivers.</p><p>It helps that during the same 4 years we have had OpenGL on mobile drive the separation of duties between EGL and GLES (v2+). These changes, with all the refactorings, have also provided a cleaner split on desktop - to the point that it is no longer absolutely necessary to provide full OpenGL implementation. You can, for most parts, expect that EGL just works; that DRM and KMS both just work; and that your highly optimised GLES implementation can happily live on top of these layers.</p><p>As a result, your closed driver offering has less to override. Of course it&#x27;s going to be less unstable!</p><p>Disclosure: in my previous job, I helped integrate couple of EGL+GLES driver stacks with Wayland on mobile systems. I learned to hate mobile GPU drivers with a passion.</p><p>P.S.: I haven&#x27;t read enough about Vulkan to know if it improves things or not.</p><p>0: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IVpOyKCNZYw\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IVpOyKCNZYw</a></p>","points":null,"parent_id":13143222,"story_id":13142285,"children":[{"id":13145356,"created_at_i":1481372815,"type":"comment","author":"aseipp","text":"<p>&gt; In effect, if you wanted to run linux, you were best off without NVIDIA.</p><p>Depends on your choices.

While they were piling on support for newer drivers in their proprietary stack, they were leaving triaged bugs open for years.

As a result, we didn&#x27;t have things like <i>Z Buffering</i> in the drivers until this year. But despite that, the drivers were in a much better shape.</p><p>This discussion (which if you read the dri-devel thread, ended with the ATi guys saying &quot;we&#x27;re sorry. we&#x27;ll do better&quot;) is happening because AMD&#x27;s marketing department dictates that they keep as much of the driver closed and developed in-house as possible. They&#x27;re completely opening the kernel driver, but every layer above that is planned to be closed. There will be a free Mesa&#x2F;Xorg&#x2F;Wayland stack developed by volunteers <i>in parallel</i> with the proprietary drivers, for those that actually want to use their computer and not experience kernel panics (at a performance cost, due to not having full documentation of the card). Oh yeah, the proprietary drivers haven&#x27;t even <i>begun</i> support for Wayland yet, and probably won&#x27;t for another year or two.</p><p>This is a step up from before, mind you; AMD&#x27;s previous setup under fglrx was a closed-source kernel driver with binary blobs, which would usually require a recompile every time you upgraded your kernel. In addition, because their software team was insane, they would take a snapshot <i>once a year</i> of the mainline kernel&#x2F;X11, and build against that instead of merging to the latest tree. This means that all distros would have to pin their kernel&#x2F;Xorg packages to a specific version (again, a year out of date), otherwise you just plain wouldn&#x27;t have accellerated video. Arch (and other rolling distros) got so fed up with it that they stopped building fglrx in their repository, forcing people to use the open radeon&#x2F;si&#x2F;hd drivers. You had to do a rather immense amount of voodoo (add third-party repository, pin xorg&#x2F;kernel to ancient versions included only in that repository, <i>downgrade</i> packages) just to get them working. If there&#x27;s an exploit in the kernel or xorg, tough. If you want to have system uptime measured in days&#x2F;weeks&#x2F;months, tough. If you want Xinerama (good multi-monitor that plays nice with xrandr) support, tough.</p><p>In comparison, this new situation is a lot better. AMD is at least playing nice with the kernel developers, and the development team has fought enough with the marketing department to embrace a semi-open development model, which is where this dri-devel discussion comes in. We also got a pretty good inside view of way that AMD develops drivers&#x2F;hardware, and some amusing commentary by the dri-devel maintainers (including Intel employees) about how screwed-up AMD&#x27;s internal culture is to produce these sorts of problems. For instance, their software team cannot communicate with the hardware team, because by the time the drivers are started, the hardware team has moved on to another card, and all the knowledge is pretty much lost&#x2F;changed&#x2F;irrelevant. This bears repeating: the hardware and drivers are developed <i>separately</i> and at <i>different times</i>.</p><p>The end result of the thread is that they&#x27;re going to split this 100,000 lines of hardware abstraction into much smaller chunks and merge it piece by piece. Hopefully this means that AMDGPU will be worth using in Kernel 4.10 or 4.11, depending on how long it takes.</p><p>I&#x27;m still using intel&#x27;s mesa&#x2F;kernel drivers in my chromebook.

Marketing <i>is</i> an important function of business - otherwise one  could easily go broke waiting for people discover on their own what great goods or services a business has to offer. In a busy marketplace, getting and keeping buyers&#x27; attention is a necessary first step to developing a business relationship.</p><p>But a <i>lot</i> of marketing people seem to think that the best way to do this is to annoy potential or existing customers, so that their employer&#x27;s brand will always come to mind first, even if it is tainted with somewhat negative feelings about the product. In one way, I don&#x27;t blame them - that technique is empirically proven to work, marketing people want to meet their targets, get paid, and go home like everyone else does, and the uncertain nature of business communication makes it difficult to adjust to the information preferences of each individual consumer.</p><p>But in another way, I do blame them, for two reasons. One, because they are deliberately choosing to clutter up people&#x27;s lives with unwanted solicitations of attention, often despite specifically being asked not to. One thing I really miss about living in the Netherlands is that the post office there gives you stickers you can put on your mail box&#x2F;slot to indicate whether you are willing to accept different kinds of commercial mail, both generic and personal.</p><p>Two, because a great deal of marketing material goes beyond a solicitation and description of goods and services and into bullshit and deception. Almost every marketing professional I&#x27;ve ever met seems to think that some dishonesty in commercial matters is OK. It&#x27;s understandable, as they&#x27;re partly backed by a legal system that historically regards many false claims in advertising as &#x27;mere puffery&#x27; - essentially saying that because consumers are exposed to a lot of bullshit anyway, it&#x27;s OK to bullshit them.</p><p>I disagree, and the greater the degree of bullshit I receive from any given business, the more likely I am to retaliate against them in some fashion, by adding them to spam lists, badmouthing them within my social circle, or occasionally responding with bullshit communications of my own designed to waste their time - followed up with helpful comparisons to their own marketing materials so they understand that deception doesn&#x27;t pay.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13141602,"story_id":13141602,"children":[{"id":13142565,"created_at_i":1481323892,"type":"comment","author":"amelius","text":"<p>&gt; Marketing is an important function of business</p><p>But it is dysfunctional, or even anti-functional, for the economy.

Before engraving any actual notes, I&#x27;ll make a voice that is entirely &quot;skips&quot;, plus time signatures, key changes, barlines, etc. I include this voice on each stave.</p><p>3. I always try to deconstruct the piece into individual voices. Of course, this is straightforward for many pieces (choral and instrumental especially), but every piece with good voice-leading can be broken up like this. My music theory background (I was a Music &amp; Comp-Sci double-major in college), along with my experience as a chorister and organist, helps me a lot with this.</p><p>4. Engrave one voice at a time. For some pieces, this means that I&#x27;m engraving half of a stave&#x27;s notes (or less) in each pass.</p><p>5. In most cases, I put a single measure on each line. I make sure to use bar-checks whenever possible (once in a while they won&#x27;t work, if I&#x27;m doing something weird that confuses LilyPond). Every fifth measure, I add a comment with the measure number (to match up with the numbers I&#x27;ve written on the physical score).</p><p>6.

When I was doing tons of engraving, I had a document holder with a movable marker to help me keep my place. I rotated one of my monitors to portrait to show a full page; I&#x27;d keep the markup on the other monitor, and had a keyboard shortcut set up to easily run LilyPond as needed. I&#x27;d often run it after making just a change or too.</p><p>8. LilyPond&#x27;s layout engine is astonishingly good, but I&#x27;d still have to make tweaks to the final output in some cases.

I think the answer lies somewhere in sort of the &quot;death of the author&quot; problem in that language ceases to be useful in discussing certain questions past a certain level of abstraction and thus abstract communication is doomed to be imprecise such that we sound like we&#x27;re repeating ourselves when we might not actually be. The revolutions in philosophical understanding, then, would seem to happen almost as if by chance: somebody articulates a shared meaning so successfully that its presence is evident to other people where once it was hidden. This is sort of what Wittgenstein was getting at I believe with Tractatus and the proposition that philosophical misunderstandings are shortcomings of language and thus if you can manage to simplify language enough that overloaded, idiosyncratic, and imprecise meanings are eliminated then you can formally deduce all of philosophy from a few first principles. I&#x27;m butchering him of course but this attitude is similar among lots of analytics and (as far as I know) originates with Wittgenstein and Russell. A meta-narrative so to speak of the continental approach would seem to be something along the lines of creating and articulating original ideas with universal scope which are not perhaps falsifiable but provoke thought in the subject.

It&#x27;s a claim presented without supporting evidence. Trying to outright refute it is really hard because there&#x27;s not much to grasp in all this alluring rhetoric. Here&#x27;s another whopper occurring earlier than my last quote:</p><p>&gt; Political leftism tends to monism, and rightism to dualism. The communal mode tends to mistake the logic of stage 4 for rightish ideologies, particularly capitalism. However, stage 4 is not inherently rightist or anti-leftist. Marxism is a systematic, technical, rational critique of capitalism—and therefore a stage 4 ideology. (Notwithstanding that campus communists rarely understand Marxism’s details, and often misuse it as a simple stage 3 rejection of systematicity.) John Rawls’ Theory of Justice is an elegant stage 4 systematic justification for leftism. Conversely, stage 3 rightism is common; that is the appeal of simplistic calls to “protect our traditional communities.”</p><p>This guy thinks he&#x27;s better at liberal arts than liberal arts majors and there is no justification for this level of arrogance presented here. This is just a constant stream of assertions that, I guess, are internally consistent but because they don&#x27;t actually engage with the texts he makes claims about or the people who study those texts and ideologies don&#x27;t actually say anything. The rhetoric is structured in a way that it gives everything a tinge of truthiness without doing any of the hard work of demonstrating something as true.</p><p>&quot;Conversely, stage 3 rightism is common; that is the appeal of simplistic calls to “protect our traditional communities.”&quot; Unraveling the condescension, the author clearly thinks everything in this world is driven by ideas and ideology. That doesn&#x27;t <i>make any fucking sense</i>. For example, the resurgence of far-right politics in Europe and America didn&#x27;t happen just because a bunch of people decided to start believing new ideas, but because they are driven by material circumstances, like the evolution of capitalism leading to large numbers of people in America&#x27;s interior losing their middle class status and any hope of economic mobility, or the use of the &quot;war on terror&quot; as a justification for the expansion of the mass-surveillance state, the destabilization of the Middle East, and the subsequent refugee crisis in Europe.</p><p>If he understood Marx <i>at all</i>, and he <i>better</i> if he&#x27;s going to make claims about Marxism and have the <i>gall</i> to note how much better he understands Marx than those &quot;campus communists&quot;, then he&#x27;d know how deeply materialist analysis utterly eviscerates his ideas. Ah, tut tut. I must be incapable of <i>truly understanding</i> stage 4 of his pokemon evolution of human enlightenment.</p><p>&gt; The communal mode is characteristic of pre-modern (“traditional”) cultures. It’s impossible to base a large-scale society on the communal mode, because it’s so ineffective at coordinating complex group activities. (If individuals frequently fail to do their specific, agreed tasks, nothing can get done.) Modern societies are based on the systematic mode (stage 4).</p><p>This is beyond hilarious and to be quite honest implicitly white supremacist. Let&#x27;s ignore all of the Native American societies whose structures not only influenced but <i>directly informed</i> many modern institutions. The examples I have in mind are the Iroquois and the Navajo. Show this text to any anthropologist and they will either roll their eyes so hard they pull a muscle or laugh until they suffocate and pass out. Only mild hyperbole.</p><p>In short, lots, and lots and <i>lots</i> of assertions that sound nice together but have nothing backing them up and just end up being so much loquacious pseudointellectual masturbation.

It is a collaborative accomplishment of dynamic interaction. One might say that it lives in the space-between subject and object; or that it pervades the situation in which it manifests, including both subject and object. But these metaphors are misleading; meanings simply don’t have locations.</p><p>First - what? This is the kind of drivel people in drum circles mutter about, not rigorous thought. This is pseudo-religious psychobabble, informed and supported by nothing but a hunch. To reject all of the worlds religious traditions, authors from Camus to Nietzsche, and several thousand years of disciplined human thought in favor of this guy&#x27;s musings on a website would be the height of insanity. To be more specific:</p><p>I understand that eternalism is unfavorable in the scientific mind, and don&#x27;t feel too much need to explain or defend it. Though I will say this: if we live in a deterministic and finite universe, then everything has some sense of meaning or purpose, at least insofar as its relationship to the other moving parts. Eastern philosophy hints at this sort of part-to-whole meaningfulness constantly, to dismiss it wholesale in favor of your prejudice for your own wonky beliefs is the height of chauvinism.</p><p>His bias towards nihilism was sickening as well as wholly circular. First, nihilists generally believe that &quot;life has no meaning&quot; - which is a good place to start the debate. If we believe that rocks have no meaning, that plants or clouds have no meaning, then what makes us so special? What exactly gives <i>us</i> meaning? Are we not a coincidence in the great book of history? Are we to just blindly commit the fallacy of placing ourselves at the center of our beliefs about how the universe works? I&#x27;m not saying that nihilism is the <i>one true way</i> or anything (as I&#x27;m not with Eastern religion) but I am saying that it&#x27;s more coherent and rational than this dude&#x27;s blog.</p><p>Furthermore, it is okay to be a nihilist and have preferences about things while accepting that those preferences are either arbitrary, irrelevant to the world outside of them, pre-determined, unstable, or in some other way meaningless. In support of his belief that nihilism is obviously wrong, he generally points to a belief that &quot;it doesn&#x27;t work&quot; or that meaning is obvious - when it clearly isn&#x27;t. If meaning were obvious, why the hell would you have to write a half baked e-book about it? That which is truly obvious doesn&#x27;t need the kind of straw-grasping this guy attempts to rationalize his worldview.</p><p>In closing, I give this article a 2&#x2F;10. I did like his emphasis on the practical, and on stances over ideologies. But the actual content is barren- marred by a need to make up new words while ignoring the work of others, as well as a totally lackluster conclusion that gets in its own way for lack of supporting detail. This is what happens when you give someone with apparently no formal understanding of the history of thought a platform to espouse their Freshman-level beliefs about the way the universe works to a crowd of interested onlookers.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13136458,"story_id":13136458,"children":[]}]},{"id":13142372,"created_at_i":1481322073,"type":"story","author":"tastyface","title":"Ask HN: Maybe I kind of suck as a programmer – how do I supercharge my work?","url":null,"text":"<p>I&#x27;m in my late twenties and I&#x27;m having a bit of a tough time dealing with my level of programming skill.</p><p>Over the past 3 years, I&#x27;ve released a few apps on iOS: not bad, nothing that would amaze anyone here.

To analogize to weightlifting, one of my favorite things to analogize against, you can see that someone lifted a lot, and you see that they did in fact lift it all by themselves, but you don&#x27;t see how they get to that point, and you can&#x27;t simply put on the same number of plates on the bar and hope to succeed.</p><p>A likewise naive path is to copy example code, do something slightly different from it, and then wonder why it&#x27;s broken. You can&#x27;t be really great at programming by doing that, because you&#x27;re abdicating so much control to wishful thinking: &quot;I hope this example author considered my use case!&quot;</p><p>What you can do - and you probably have the guts to do it, if you&#x27;re writing 30 KLOC apps on your own time - is to attack things one technique at a time, and to attack the hardest, most lasting stuff first before you get into more specialized and ephemeral knowledge like API calls. It&#x27;s the adjustment of what you care about that leads you to direct your coding towards unfamiliar yet profitable roads, where you have to envision very big ideas that aren&#x27;t in place yet, struggle with them for days or weeks, and ultimately find a great technique that you can reuse in the future.</p><p>To take one example, UI code is wonderful stuff for adding end-user value. But if you want extreme leverage in your code it can&#x27;t be the first priority, because it&#x27;s also stuff that tends to be thrown out frequently - because other features change, or you&#x27;re on a new toolkit, or you found a slicker design. You have to instead allow the UI to be too crude at first, and think about application features as a layer apart from the UI. And then only as you come towards the end, confident that the core features are correct and will be robust against a partially-working UI, can you go back and invest in a great presentation.</p><p>Likewise, it&#x27;s tempting to make code that is clever in-the-small, at the moment you first dip into making a new feature; to invent class hierarchies and configuration objects and generics and other nifty things. But what you need most at that moment where it&#x27;s new is the most boring, plain code possible, because if you don&#x27;t know the problem space yet, anything clever that might add structure or allude to generalizing the problem along any one axis is likely to do so wrongly, and the most flexible you can be is to assume it&#x27;s all disposable and should be extended with copy-paste-modify. Fancy language features were made to break through problems with the crude techniques, so if you follow with that grain and only add the features after you feel pain, everything tends to go much more smoothly.</p><p>Most of all, it&#x27;s scary to take on seemingly big problems, but it&#x27;s scary in a way that should not influence your decision whether or not to attack them. These problems feel big mostly because they aren&#x27;t well understood to <i>you</i>. In the same way that math students are prompted to take on gradually more ambitious levels of abstraction, you have to do the same with your code. You start with your bad assumptions and knock them out with a dash of computer science knowledge, and a lot more trial and error. There will be bugs and bad decisions along the way, but you can also learn defensive techniques against them. Some attempts to defend your code may just make it harder to write or more brittle; others will succeed dramatically.

If you spend time debugging, identify what sort of bugs you are creating and try to go over books that cover most common programming bugs and try to incorporate them during programming time itself.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13142372,"story_id":13142372,"children":[]},{"id":13156281,"created_at_i":1481527339,"type":"comment","author":"codetoon","text":"<p>It is important to realize our current situation before we can upgrade yourself, so it is good you know that and are willing to do that.</p><p>Personally I believe that everyone has some natural strengths in one domain or another, that gives them an edge to do things a lot faster and can learn and understand things lot faster. For example I can understand technical stuff lot better and can learn new programming stuff lot faster, than I could ever learn playing a guitar or designing :) I believe that the people you mentioned above are excellent programmers&#x2F;architects and beyond that they have seen and dealt with more situations than any one doing regular programming. They might have built complex stuffs, they have read a lot - books and open source code, cleared the concepts, they have grown their knowledge and they have implemented it where they could. Basically your programming skills improve by doing complex stuff. Applying what you have learn&#x27;t whenever you get a chance (no matter how simple or complex the product could be). Implementing elegant solutions to problems that can have N possible solutions and no compromises.</p><p>I don&#x27;t say that being a programmer I cannot become a good musician but I think that the music I produce won&#x27;t match the quality of the code or program that I would write, and even if I could do it - it requires a great deal of effort time and dedication which I wouldn&#x27;t have required at that scale for coding.

You stack feature upon feature, and once the system gets big enough, it&#x27;s getting hard to get a proper grip of what is actually happening. So you start monkey patching, and you start to regret not having written any integration tests that would tell you when you introduce regressions.</p><p>State has to be managed rigidly. If you cannot deduce what semantic state your app is in while you debug, then chances are things will go wrong.</p><p>I have found two approaches that work for me: Reactive programming, and good old state machines. The former is needed when there is so much state that the latter would be too complex (too many possible permutations &gt; too many states to grasp).</p><p>Every property that your screen has (element A is hidden, element B has this text, animation C is in flight...) should be derived from the current screen&#x27;s state machine or stream of values. Meaning, state 1 will set A to hidden, B has no text, and C is stopped; state 2 will set A to not-hidden, B has text &quot;xyz&quot; and C is still stopped, etc. It&#x27;s kind of like React, but on a lower level - properties are overridden or methods are called when transitioning between states. One could call this state machine &quot;ViewModel&quot; :)\nSwift brought us Enums with attached values, so they are perfect for modeling a state machine. IMO Optionals also prevent some state sloppiness we had with Obj-C&#x27;s nil behavior.</p><p>I&#x27;m not saying state machines or Reactive programming are a panacea, but they have solved the problem for me. I&#x27;m confident in my code now, and have the feeling that I do solid work (which is good as I&#x27;m huge on feeling like an imposter). As long as I use Swift and RAC or state machines, the very most bugs I cause are of semantic nature - e.g. a button text is wrong in such and such state.

I would like to focus on your comment about race conditions. It&#x27;s very good that you have identified this weakness in your code. Writing concurrent code is hard, but it&#x27;s also valuable experience because there is no room for shortcuts. If you don&#x27;t do it right, your code <i>will</i> fail eventually. Therefore writing concurrent code, identifying bugs, and fixing them will train you to think rigorously about your code.</p><p>Diagnosing bugs often comes down an exploration of every possible sequence of events, trying to identify the pattern of sequences that triggers the bug, and figuring out how to fix it. In single-threaded code the debugger can make this task easy, but attaching a debugger (or even building in debug mode) often makes concurrency bugs go away, so you are forced to solve the problem in your head by analyzing the system. This experience is like strength training for programmers. I would suggest putting extra effort in the concurrent parts of your code, really try to make them correct.

In particular the final paragraph:</p><p>&gt; In the desperate circumstances of the time, it was excusable to be angry at what Wodehouse did, but to go on denouncing him three or four years later — and more, to let an impression remain that he acted with conscious treachery — is not excusable. Few things in this war have been more morally disgusting than the present hunt after traitors and Quislings. At best it is largely the punishment of the guilty by the guilty. In France, all kinds of petty rats — police officials, penny-a-lining journalists, women who have slept with German soldiers — are hunted down while almost without exception the big rats escape. In England the fiercest tirades against Quislings are uttered by Conservatives who were practising appeasement in 1938 and Communists who were advocating it in 1940. I have striven to show how the wretched Wodehouse — just because success and expatriation had allowed him to remain mentally in the Edwardian age — became the corpus vile in a propaganda experiment, and I suggest that it is now time to regard the incident as closed. If Ezra Pound is caught and shot by the American authorities, it will have the effect of establishing his reputation as a poet for hundreds of years; and even in the case of Wodehouse, if we drive him to retire to the United States and renounce his British citizenship, we shall end by being horribly ashamed of ourselves. Meanwhile, if we really want to punish the people who weakened national morale at critical moments, there are other culprits who are nearer home and better worth chasing.</p><p>[0] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;orwell.ru&#x2F;library&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;plum&#x2F;english&#x2F;e_plum\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;orwell.ru&#x2F;library&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;plum&#x2F;english&#x2F;e_plum</a></p>","points":null,"parent_id":13139277,"story_id":13135934,"children":[{"id":13139987,"created_at_i":1481303585,"type":"comment","author":"sriram_sun","text":"<p>Thank you!
