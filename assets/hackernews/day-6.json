It is undoubtedly easier for companies to swallow a significant cash payout to an employee when they are receiving a large corresponding cash infusion resulting from sales of a developed idea. Following implementation of an efficiency improvement, understandably, as time passes companies tend to only see the current bottom line as the norm vice seeing &quot;what could have been&quot;.

Thus, any award based on annual projected savings will also need to factor in the diminished value as a result of uncertainty. Cost savings projections are non-deterministic.</p><p>I guess my point is that I think cost savings sharing is much more complex than a profit sharing, in which you simply take a cut of any profits (albeit a significantly smaller portion since the company is assuming the development&#x2F;commercialization risk) that roll through the door.</p><p>That said, I could see cost savings awards as a one-time award based on the agreed upon value at a given time, rather than an ongoing profit sharing program that pays out until the product is no longer profitable.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13144710,"story_id":13142327,"children":[]}]}]},{"id":13154173,"created_at_i":1481498994,"type":"comment","author":"stefek99","text":"<p>&quot;Most developers think that the work they do at work belongs to their employer, but anything they work on at home or on their own time is theirs.&quot;</p><p>NOT ME.</p><p>I dread the time when in order to pay my bills I had to sign a contract...</p><p>Released all my ideas to the public domain: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;genesisdotre&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ideas-released-to-public-domain-prior-to-signing-very-restrictive-employment-contract-(January-2014)#releasing-ip-before-it-is-too-late\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;genesisdotre&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ideas-released-to-...</a></p><p>&quot;original matter, work or creation&quot; - on my occasions I wanted to ask how about:\n1) cake recipes\n2) gardening\n3) drawing with my kids\n4) urine and excrements\n5) photography</p><p>(if I was to create YouTube channel talking about philosophy that would inevitably belong to them as well)</p><p>Can we please introduce employment contracts that are fair to both sides?</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13142327,"story_id":13142327,"children":[]},{"id":13142910,"created_at_i":1481327189,"type":"comment","author":"stevesun21","text":"<p>after i figured that he is CEO and cofounder of many famous startups, I feel bias in this article and I will make sure I will not work him in the future for sure :-)</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13142327,"story_id":13142327,"children":[{"id":13143735,"children":[]}]},{"id":13143935,"children":[]},{"id":13142912,"created_at_i":1481327193,"type":"comment","author":"rjurney","text":"<p>You ALL need to read California Labor Code 2870!</p><p>Surprised nobody has mentioned the most essential thing to know about regarding this stuff in California.

But actual actions in Companies Court are rare. If you were in need of stopping a rogue director in their actions, or others in acting upon rogue instructions, you would wan to rush down to Applications Court, with as much evidence as you can grab, the pertinent law for reference, and a draft &quot;without notice&quot; application to obtain a order immediately, not waiting for anyone to reply, not wasting time politely writing cease &amp; desist of other futile letters, and most likely unless you really are mistaken, you probably will get such a order to serve to stop rogue actions, with little or no delay. Such action is easily within the competence of most anyone here, to quickly prepare and present. You will find the Master Of Court, himself usually a senior judge, acting as a &quot;doorman&quot; or &quot;bouncer&quot; to prevent rubbish cases wasting the court&#x27;s time. The Master is exactly who can be willing to get your application in good order, something I know no remotely affordable solicitor can do, within the time necessary, or at all. The experience in court is infinitely less troubling or intimidating, than the real worries you likely are facing, time of your visit.

It&#x27;s really worth getting a chat with anyone there able to still give their time and not attached to a ACD headset, but in  real office, I wholeheartedly recommend inquiring beyond casual call center contact, if the moment offers itself to do so.</p><p>FWIW, my most rewarding, productive, and of all my experiences  the least every worried about money, collaboration in business, was with a family friend and henceforth, my friend, who sadly passed away unexpectedly and far too young, a decade ago. But my experience of &quot;doing business with a friend&quot; is almost unique, and we almost vied with one another competitively to be &quot;by the book&quot; and compliant with our duties to one another and company because of lousy earlier experiences. If anything, I think we raised that to the point of being a unnecessarily high cost, at least from our time. But it was absolutely a superb and indeed rare case of continuous trust building, which didn&#x27;t supplant other necessary trust creating behaviour, nor detract or affect life negatively in any way. (e.g. bothering too much about being &quot;above board&quot; never caused one of us to think the other was &quot;overdoing it much&quot; for the wrong reasons. I can merely hope I&#x27;ll have as good a experience again. But one huge positive legacy of all that exercise in transparency and proper discharge of our duties, really made me acutely aware of how I&#x27;ve just not met anyone since who I felt could meet my late partner&#x27;s standards.

At least the Act, alone. I&#x27;ve even enjoyed a very candid conversation at some length with the Registrar Of Companies, when the last major Act came into force, and she was incredibly helpful and illuminating, explaining the nuances of her statutory role and its offices. For guidance as to effect of Articles or Association, please do ask their Compliance office. Articles or Table A are the bylaws of a company, and many sharp operators will try to get Companies House to accept heavily modified articles, which contradict or attempt to restrict, statutory rights, roles or obligations. There was once a inactive registered company, names Silverstone blah blah management, about the time of a rumoured bid for control of the motor racing circuit. I pulled the Table A, and none to my surprise, almost every page of it was marked in the margin, alongside almost every paragraph, with a dot or a code, indicating Compliance was highly suspect of this document, as to its legality. But, as Compa ies House began to intone by reflex, I remember the information becoming a mantra when inquiring about almost anything, they are only a records office, not enforcers. The Registrar told me in addition, that that year sh had budget and allowance (I got the sense as if she felt it was a deliberately token allowance, arbitrarily set somehow and not under her budgetary power, to prosecute four directors each month, for technical breaches of the law. I had presented her office with a single director, for whom records tallied literally hundreds of summary offences.</p><p>Larger but less scrupulous or less publicly reported companies, flout the law routinely, a trivial cost of doing business. Small fly by nights and sham &quot;business partners&quot; you may encounter, may roll right over you, in a instant. You might be a director and have majority equity in common shares, but another director may (quite unlawfully, but see further) de-register you as a director, call a company meeting, if one is even required, dilute you to nothing, seek shareholder approval for consolidating fraudulent actions, like divesting working capital via special dividend, and banks will almost in every single case, do as they are told if the right forms are provided. You will sure have recourse under the Act, and many summary (not tried but assessed on the facts by a judge) offenses are criminal and even punishable by imprisonment, but you would be lost without a proper management contract and ideally a law firm of repute contracted as Company Secretary and that contract specifying detailed additional procedures, even clerical checks and notifications help here, and ultimately if thus sort of thing happens, you are in real trouble with little real recourse and no immediate remedy.</p><p>That&#x27;s a mere taste of the fun which can be English Limited Companies!</p><p>From memory, and it&#x27;s long since I undertook any comparative study, only Sweden has laws which truly make a manager &#x2F; managing director, responsible for their behaviour, under real penalty. Obviously, don&#x27;t take my word for it, but I was seeking answer to just this: &quot;So where can I risk turning my back one second, on a limited company I invest in?&quot;, and Sweden was the only jurisdiction which I felt satisfied me.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13144945,"story_id":13142327,"children":[]},{"id":13148036,"created_at_i":1481405521,"type":"comment","author":"bjelkeman-again","text":"<p>Which is one of the reasons my last effort is a not for profit.

We separate between three types of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs): High spontaneous rate (HSR), low spontaneous rate (LSR) and mid spontaneous rate (MSR). Basically the HSRs are our high gain fibers used for low sound levels. Their response saturates quite early. LSRs on the other hand are low gain fibers used for higher levels.</p><p>the ANF synapse can release a large amount of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft (in this case glutamate) the problem is that high concentrations of glutamate can are actually harmful and HSR fibers seem to be quite sensitive to these high concentrations. If there is a long term exposure to a noisy environment the high glutamate concentration might selectively kills your HSR fibers. The problem with this is that your threshold of hearing is still normal as there is no damage to the HSR fibers which you need to detect low level sounds so your audiogram looks perfectly fine. But you will start to get problems if you are in situations where you need your full dynamic range e.g. understanding speech in a noisy environments.</p><p>As you can see from my writing, this is a current subject of research so we do not know for sure but it seems like that you have to be quite careful with long time noise exposure even if the sound levels are below what is normally considered as harmful.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13140179,"story_id":13139978,"children":[{"id":13140981,"created_at_i":1481310567,"type":"comment","author":"Chico75","text":"<p>It sounds a lot like what I am experiencing too.

Here are a few that come to mind:</p><p>1.  A better system for automation and measurement.  Current solutions aren&#x27;t ideal when it comes to setting up new systems as well as updating and maintaining existing systems.  We build several million dollar facilities a month and each one has automation and measurement equipment that has to be individually set up and programmed.  Each technician does things a slightly different way, and the end result is a different set of automation and measurement logic at each facility.</p><p>2) Fiber optic DATS (distributed acoustic and temperature sensing) data handling and interpretation.  This is a fairly new type of technology in which a fiber optic line is installed in the wellbore.  The fiber optic line basically acts as a 15,000&#x27; strand of thermometers and microphones placed every 3&#x27;. The data from one installation is on the order of terabytes per hour.  Oil and gas service companies that offer this service don&#x27;t know how to handle this amount of data.  The problem could probably be solved with S3 or something.</p><p>3) Drilling optimization. Create a software suite that utilizes ML&#x2F;AI to help drilling engineers figure out the best way to drill a well is. It&#x27;s a perfect ML&#x2F;AI application. Lots and lots of training data available,  easily defined input and output parameters, etc. Drilling engineering is full of hard, non-linear problems and humans are just really bad at it.

Most files (patches, signatures) are composed of an uncompressed header, and a brotli-compressed stream (in the reference implementation, compression format are pluggable) of other messages.</p><p>- The main diff method is based on rsync. It&#x27;s slightly tuned, in that: it operates over the hashes of all files (which means rename tracking is seamless - the reference implementation detects that and handles it efficiently), and it takes into account partial blocks (at the end of files, smaller than the block size)</p><p>- The reference implementation is quite modular Go, which is nice for portability, and, like elisee mentioned, used in production at itch.io. We assume most things are streaming (so that, for example, you can apply a patch while downloading it, no temporary writes to disk needed), we actually use a virtual file system for all downloads and updates.</p><p>- The reference implementation contains support for block-based (4MB default) file delivery, which is useful for a verify&#x2F;heal process (figure out which parts are missing&#x2F;have been corrupted and correct them)</p><p>- The wharf repo contains the basis of a second diff method, based on rsync - for a secondary patch optimization step. The bsdiff algorithm is well-commented with references to the original paper, and there&#x27;s an opt-in parallel bsdiff codepath (as in multi-core suffix sorting, not just bsdiff operating on chunks)</p><p>- A few other companies (including well-known gaming actors) have started reaching out &#x2F; using parts of wharf for their own usage, I&#x27;ll happily name names as soon as it&#x27;s all become more public :)</p><p>I&#x27;d be happy to answer any questions!</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13141399,"story_id":13139638,"children":[{"id":13143087,"created_at_i":1481329236,"type":"comment","author":"scrollaway","text":"<p>That&#x27;s quite incredibly thorough.

The first file is a small standalone computer program called RegisterEvent.exe, which allows you to create your own registration files. So you won&#x27;t have to register with Douglass Associates and you won&#x27;t have to pay a registration fee. You can read more about RegisterEvent and how to use it below. The second file is a ZIP file containing all the source code for COMPMNGR and its supporting programs.

I have two main complaints about it:</p><p>1. The UX is subpar. It insists on running in only a single tab at a time, and attempts to open multiple tabs will instead override whatever it considers to be the master tab. This is a huge pain, because I often need to have a mapping workflow open in one window and some other relevant part of the application open in another. Instead I have to save, go find the thing I want, and go back. Another problem is that when working with data sources containing tons of fields, there&#x27;s no easy way to search.</p><p>2. It offers an expression language to perform some computational tasks, similar to what you&#x27;d find in Excel, but it&#x27;s hamstrung by a poor UI and a limited amount of functions. The built-in editor for expressions is really poor (see Tableau for an example of a great editor for a simple Excel-like language; it even has type linting) and, unless I&#x27;ve misunderstood something, you can&#x27;t declare any variables so you end up with huge nested expressions. There aren&#x27;t many functions available, so something as simple as removing whitespace ends up as lstrip(rstrip(foo)). In combination with no support for statements (or at least a let expression like in lisp) this makes any nontrivial data munging completely indecipherable.</p><p>I&#x27;ve looked around in this space and it seems like there are a variety of products, but the supplier of our main CRM will only support Informatica Cloud. I think that a company that can offer a product that does what you&#x27;ve said but makes a serious effort at UX could cause users to revolt and demand to use it! I know the joke is that Slack is just a pretty IRC with better UX... but that&#x27;s exactly why it has become so successful.</p><p>In terms of data munging, take a look at Microsoft&#x27;s Power BI. It&#x27;s visualization software but it has a nice data munging mode that, crucially, keeps track of all the changes you make and displays them in a linear format. This is great for getting a quick idea as to what was done with the data and is essential for doing reproducible data analyses. Unfortunately, Power BI also suffers from poor UX in insisting on tiny fonts and gray-on-gray palettes that are totally unreadable to anyone over 30.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13140352,"story_id":13139638,"children":[]},{"id":13140377,"children":[]},{"id":13140381,"created_at_i":1481306319,"type":"comment","author":"juskrey","text":"<p>Will hedge funds take such a huge risk of using 3rd party centralized (or centrally developed) data management system?</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13140352,"story_id":13139638,"children":[{"id":13140502,"created_at_i":1481307132,"type":"comment","author":"otoburb","text":"<p>Provided they can deploy the 3rd party solution onsite (aka &quot;on premise&quot;), this wouldn&#x27;t be seen as a &quot;huge risk&quot;.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13140381,"story_id":13139638,"children":[{"id":13140529,"created_at_i":1481307303,"type":"comment","author":"juskrey","text":"<p>And what about the risk of 3rd party dev error which will throw several funds at once out of the business?</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13140502,"story_id":13139638,"children":[{"id":13140706,"created_at_i":1481308489,"type":"comment","author":"otoburb","text":"<p>Great question, but I don&#x27;t see this much different from other industries or companies with millions or billions of dollars at stake.

Plus our fees are driven more by the market than by our actual costs, so if we billed fewer hours, we would simply bill at a higher rate to reach the same expected fee while still maintaining our position in the marketplace. Or if we could reduce our fee, we might be able to win more market share.</p><p>The pejorative term in the industry for padding billing with useless busy work is &quot;fee justification,&quot; which really shouldn&#x27;t ever be necessary. Especially in my practice area, because there&#x27;s always more work that can be done to flesh out our deliverables, which in turn makes them more effective for convincing the IRS (or state equivalent) or an appeals judge. When I say I&#x27;ve cut thousands of dollars of charge hours, we didn&#x27;t simply stop charging those hours, we allocated them to more useful, value added activities.</p><p>Right now, staff spend far too much time inefficiently manipulating data in Excel, manually organizing exhibits, and a variety of other mundane, low cognitive effort tasks (I can&#x27;t really specify what kinds because that would essentially doxx me). They feel productive, they look productive, and they meet their charge hour goals. And it allows them to procrastinate on the more mentally taxing work, like evaluating the relevant legal and technical tax issues, which in turn detracts from the quality of our service. Our clients aren&#x27;t paying us to be extra-expensive outsourced spreadsheet monkeys. They&#x27;re paying us to eliminate uncertainty about complicated legal and tax issues. So freeing up engagement budget and the staff&#x27;s mental bandwidth to focus on the high value added cognitive services is tremendously useful in improving quality.</p><p>And in terms of time, we compete on that in some cases where there&#x27;s an audit, exam, or appeal deadline and the client came to us late in the game.

If you can&#x27;t agree on that, then every time a new version comes out the web is split and the caching doesn&#x27;t work, and every time someone decides to use another CDN (or someone provides a new one) the group is split again.</p><p>But then split that across all the fonts, formats, and compression schemes available and you&#x27;ll see that the chance that a visitor has seen that font, at that version, from that CDN, using that compression scheme, in that format at any point in the past EVER is actually significantly smaller than you&#x27;d think.</p><p>Which brings us into the next point. Even if you&#x27;ve seen it before, the chances that you&#x27;ll have it cached is pretty small. Browser caches are suprisingly small in the grand scheme of things, and people tend to clear them more often than you think. Add in privacy browser mode and &quot;PC cleaner&quot; programs and the average person&#x27;s caches lasts much shorter than at least I expected it to.</p><p>But even worse are mobile caches. IIRC older android had something like a 4MB cache!!! And until very recently safari had something like a 50mb limit (and before that didn&#x27;t cache ANYTHING to disk!). Now it&#x27;s better, but you are still looking at a few hundred MB of cache. And with images getting bigger, big GIFs being common, huge amounts of AJAX requests happening all the time in most web pages, you&#x27;ll find that the browser cache is completely cycled through on a scale of days or hours not weeks or months.</p><p>IMO it&#x27;s at the point where the &quot;dream&quot; of using a CDN and having a large percentage of your users already have the item in their cache isn&#x27;t going to work out, and you are better off bundling stuff yourself and doing something like &quot;dead code elimination&quot; to get rid of anything you don&#x27;t use. And that method only becomes more powerful when you start looking at custom caching and updating solutions. A few months ago I saw a library that was designed to only download a delta of an asset and store it in localstorage so updates to the application code only need to download what changed and not the whole thing again.
