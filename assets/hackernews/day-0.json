Those numbers are from our last bill and include AT&amp;T fees (including their HDTV receiver fees in 2016), government taxes, etc.  We got an HDTV quite early (circa 2004) and at the time went from Dish Network to DirecTV.  And for internet, we separately paid for AT&amp;T DSL, which might have been at 3Mbps for a mid-tier package at the time. Around 2009&#x2F;2010 an AT&amp;T salesman came to our door to talk about this new Uverse offering in our neighborhood.  They talked about it being fiber, just like Fios from Verizon (though I suspected it wasn&#x27;t really the same since our streets never were dug up- which is in line with it being fiber to the main node outside of our housing tract.) They enticed my parents to get out of their expensive contract with DirecTV and pay less for the same TV package with an included DVR accessible to the entire home, and a faster internet speed without any contract, or equipment rental fees.  The offer was hard to pass up and was a better deal than signing up for a contract with TWC, paying a lower price for year 1 and then getting ripped off for your second year of the contract.  I vaguely remember it was something like $100 or $120 when we signed up for the TV and internet service.  The internet speeds were always lower than advertised and occasionally the TV would drop out but it became more reliable over time.  At some point were offered a lower rate to sign up for a 2 year contract, and though we did, I think it has since expired and may be back on a month-to-month device.  The problem with their service has always been some box dying after a year or so, and calling their support number (which redirects to a call center in the Philippines typically) to have them dispatch a technician but other than that, the technicians are usually very well trained and get the problem fixed right the first time, and allow us to call them back for 30 days after the service call for help without contacting their main support line.</p><p>My parents have heard horror stories from TWC customers who have been overcharged, service that has been poor, and squabbles with home internet data caps (of which ATT has none- at least as shown on our bill). We could go with something like a DSLExtreme or Sonic.net, but then our TV bill would go up.

The article doesn&#x27;t tell you enough to decide, so you should look at the paper.</p><p>2) Doing anything that attenuates the effects of an accelerated aging phenotype, actually usually a DNA repair disorder, almost always has nothing to do with aging as it happens in normal individuals. You can hit mice with hammers, and then evaluate the effects of a hammer-blocking cage, but that doesn&#x27;t tell you anything about aging - and for exactly the same reasons. This is generally true except when it is isn&#x27;t, and that depends on the fine details. Again, go look at the paper.</p><p>3) The interesting experiment is the one in which pluripotency-inducing factors are upregulated in a normal mouse, but temporarily. This is the thing that people have looked at in the past and said, well, turning on widespread transformation of somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells sounds like a really bad idea. Cancer seems the likely outcome, and that has in fact been demonstrated in a couple of studies in mice, but there is also the point that your central nervous system rather relies upon maintaining the fine structure it has established in many cases, such as data stored in the brain. Running in and randomly reprogramming any CNS cells that take up the vector or the pluripotency signals seems like a bad idea on the face of it.</p><p>So on the whole it is fascinating that a good outcome was produced in the normal mice, analogous to the sort of thing that has been produced via stem cell transplants and telomerase gene therapies. But I&#x27;d still want to see what happens to the mice over the long term after that, and would expect cancer.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13189864,"story_id":13189864,"children":[]},{"id":13191582,"created_at_i":1481871483,"type":"comment","author":"known","text":"<p>METFORMIN also does the same <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;431663&#x2F;scientists-want-to-treat-aging-like-a-disease-and-they-already-have-drugs-for-it&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;431663&#x2F;scientists-want-to-treat-aging-like-a-d...</a> and <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;briefing&#x2F;21704788-fight-cheat-death-hotting-up-adding-ages\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;briefing&#x2F;21704788-fight-cheat-...</a></p>","points":null,"parent_id":13189864,"story_id":13189864,"children":[{"id":13191777,"created_at_i":1481874889,"type":"comment","author":"AstralStorm","text":"<p>Currently probably the most impressive treatment, yes.

The system operated on the presumption that everyone&#x27;s traffic increased more or less in parallel over time and so everybody&#x27;s infrastructure would be upgraded in parallel.</p><p>The problem is that Netflix now makes up a 37% share of all internet traffic.  The traditional way you do that is a CDN, and Netflix used to do that.  But in 2012 Netflix decided to save money by shifting away from CDNs into their own datacenters and purchase up all the transit capacity they could.  Basically, become their own ISP that took advantage of the gentleman&#x27;s agreement (because nobody wants to <i>send</i> any significant volume of traffic to Netflix, they have almost no infrastructure costs of their own, so the inherent detente of traffic volume falls apart).</p><p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;256586&#x2F;the-inside-story-of-how-netflix-came-to-pay-comcast-for-internet-traffic&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;256586&#x2F;the-inside-story-of-how-netflix-came-to...</a></p><p>The solution for Netflix was always clear, you either pay peering fees, you pay for a CDN who pays peering fees, or you pay to colocate servers with Comcast so there&#x27;s no peering involved.  The problem is that Netflix doesn&#x27;t want to pay for their infrastructure.  The rules on infrastructure costs for residential players are never, never the same as the rules for industrial users.  The fact that you paid for a driveway doesn&#x27;t mean that you will never have to pay a toll, and heavy users will actually have to pay to remediate the damage to local roads&#x2F;etc caused by their heavy traffic (used in some states&#x2F;localities where trucks carrying fracking fluid beat up the roads).  Analogously - if you make up 1&#x2F;3 of all internet traffic and are still growing rapidly, you are going to have to expect to pay for some extra infrastructure along the path your data take, even if it&#x27;s technically outside the boundary of your datacenter.</p><p>An analogous real-world &quot;gentleman&#x27;s agreement&quot; is the postal delivery system (actually it&#x27;s formalized in the Universal Postal Union treaty).  When you mail a package to Germany, the German post office gets paid almost nothing, they essentially deliver that package at a loss.  And the same applies when a German mails a package to the US.  The assumption is that this roughly nets out.  Then you get someone like China who comes along and subsidizes postage as an easy way to boost exports and help their economy, and suddenly things no longer net out.  The US government, as the &quot;last mile&quot; provider here, eventually had to file a WTO suit to get them to stop dumping.</p><p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;china-halts-export-subsidy-program-u-s-says-1460643214\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;china-halts-export-subsidy-progr...</a></p><p>So no, nothing to see here, what Netflix is doing is not part of Net Neutrality, it&#x27;s a cheap attempt to glom onto the movement to subsidize their infrastructure costs.  The same predatory tactics are roundly rebuffed when they&#x27;re done with other &quot;neutral networks&quot; like the post, and it&#x27;s been rightly rebuffed with Netflix too.   Comcast never shaped any traffic or refused to allow any customers access - they just didn&#x27;t upgrade their infrastructure to the level Netflix wanted them to until Netflix paid for it, and those links were congested.</p><p>I hate having to defend Comcast because they are a shit company with shit customer service, but if you are dropping mass volumes of data onto the network to the extent that infrastructure upgrades are necessary (again: 37% of all internet traffic is Netflix) then yeah, you get to pay for them.

Congress is only in session part of the time. Lawmaking - as opposed to politicking - currently requires a quorum and that legislators actually go on the record with both arguments and votes. It&#x27;s where the rubber of governance meets the road and politicians can&#x27;t pander to all and sundry while shrugging off criticism by saying &#x27;they misspoke&#x27; and so on, but must instead commit to some sort of position (even if they obfuscate that by engaging in bullshit legislative tricks like poison-pill amendments). When Congress is in session it&#x27;s doing (in theory at least) the Nation&#x27;s business. When it&#x27;s in recess the politicians can rest, schmooze their constituents, and so on - conducting their own political business rather than the nation&#x27;s.</p><p>Now all this sounds very fine and idealist, but for lawmaking to be valid and have credibility then there needs to be some sort of formality to the process so that the citizenry can find out what their elected representatives are actually doing on their behalf, eg by consulting the Congressional record. Of course much of what happens in the legislative chamber is theatrical most deals are negotiated and brokered behind closed doors, but the lack of accountability that inheres in such arrangements is why there is a requirement for formalities in the first place.</p><p>So because there are formal rules on how laws are made, whether Congress is in session or not <i>does</i> matter. When it&#x27;s only being kept in session by a technicality without any actual legislative work being performed, that says to everyone looking that the party engaging in such behavior regards rules as an obstruction to be got around rather than a standard for governing their own behavior, and that attitude is likely to promulgate itself among the population in various ways.</p><p>If you think recess appointments are a silly anachronism, <i>amend the constitution</i>.

And at that time, just dealing with the tools -- typically on a mainframe -- was the first couple weeks of the typical introductory programming course.</p><p>This is not entirely unusual, even today. I was curious about one of the toolchains for phone app development. For one particular tool, the tutorial for &quot;Hello World&quot; was many pages of instructions: Installing the tools, creating an empty application, setting its characteristics, adding code, building, etc. Even as an experienced programmer, I found it to be rather forbidding.</p><p>Another possible reason for a teaching language might be to excite the interests of particular age or social groups. For instance, Logo was oriented towards making interesting graphics. Scratch eliminates the need to learn syntax, and has easy-to-program graphical output.</p><p>On the other hand, some languages come pretty darn close to that old BASIC in terms of the ease of getting started, and one of those languages is Python. It seems to me that the sheer size of Python shouldn&#x27;t be a deterrent to using it for teaching: Just ignore the advanced features at first.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13186602,"story_id":13185759,"children":[{"id":13189292,"created_at_i":1481841524,"type":"comment","author":"skrishnamurthi","text":"<p>&quot;Ignore&quot; is easier said than done.

Concepts like trees, nodes, and data types have no place in an introductory programming for kids. The initial idea to teach is the notion of getting the machine to follow a set of instructions. IMHO even functions should not be forced until that notion of writing instructions for the computer to follow is mastered. Imperative is the word I&#x27;m looking for. You need to start with that. Then move on to loops, arrays (or list but don&#x27;t try to explain the difference for a while), functions. You don&#x27;t want to require any of the concepts that we all take for granted just to get started. Type systems? structures? Objects? Those need to be introduced through examples where they are used to solve specific problems.</p><p>I have some examples of how an absolute beginner may think.</p><p>I was learning about BASIC and had worked up (yeah up) to using FOR loops, IF and GOTO. Then I read about the PLOT(h,v) function which would light up a pixel on the screen - awesomeness was about to ensue. But I had the notion that - as the instruction said - I had to pass the variable h and v to that function, not whatever pair I choose. That would mean copying values from other variables (i.e. h=x, v=y, plot(h,v) and then h=i, v=k, plot(h,v)). Fortunately that notion got cleared up very quickly, but it illustrates the point that a noob may take something quite literally and not understand the simplest abstractions that we all take for granted.</p><p>On another occasion I wanted to write Pac-Man so I had variables (we didn&#x27;t even had structures available) for the player and I figured I&#x27;d use x1,y1, x2,y2, x3,y3, x4,y4 to track the positions of the ghosts. I could see in advance that I&#x27;d have to replicate the ghost logic 4 times using different variables in each instance (or write a subroutine and copy variables around like I suggested above). What I wanted was to put the logic inside a loop (for n=1 to 4) and reference the ghost variable as xn, yn but that wouldn&#x27;t work because those are just different 2-letter variables. So I asked someone if there was a way to solve this and was pointed to arrays. The notion that a construct existed that matched exactly what I wanted to do was amazing and I felt like I really must understand something if my ideas about what should be possible were already there. Try to imagine that type of discovery compared to being presented a bunch of such concepts and being expected to understand form the start.</p><p>When I got to college I figured I already knew programming. Hah! The data structures course was incredible, I could already see how all of that stuff could be applied to different things. It made perfect sense because I could already imagine how to use it in all kinds of situations.</p><p>Even the most simple concepts need to be taught slowly at first, and preferably to solve a specific problem. If your language requires too much boilerplate, type definitions, or anything else it&#x27;s too much.</p><p>So when I said this language looked like a bunch of gibberish, I was looking at it through the lens of a kid who doesn&#x27;t know shit about any of this.

I&#x27;ve only now started to notice it as I pay attention to Rust&#x27;s build systems get designed, and other details around the Rust community evolve.</p><p>I find it fascinating that lessons aren&#x27;t being learned from build systems which are built in the enterprise like Bazel, Pants, etc (honestly, I&#x27;m disappointed one of those two wasn&#x27;t just adopted by the Rust community - unclear but I think they didn&#x27;t know about them?).</p><p>Similarly, notice how &quot;Java shops&quot; have for many years enforced ever increasingly complex build pipelines (Javadoc, Junit, JaCoCo, Findbugs, ...). But these tools are slow, end up with long standing bugs when versions bump, and generally end up limited.</p><p>I find it fascinating however, that only two of the above steps (Docs, Tests) are first class in Rust. Why only those two? Why not learn from the whole Java build pipeline? Why does the compiler&#x27;s test infra not spit out metadata about lines&#x2F;branches covered? Why is clippy, like Findbugs, separate from the compiler? Isn&#x27;t &quot;better code&quot; by definition better for everyone.</p><p>It should be relatively easy for these to be built into the compiler. While some like test coverage data is really hard to get as separate tool (especially when optimizations are on). However, Rust developers have valid points like &quot;separation of concerns&quot;. Its hard to argue with them, after all we are only on the sidelines, they are actually in the thick of it. But again, there just seems to be a divide, and its interesting to see which features&#x2F;lessons are adopted, vs which features&#x2F;lessons are &quot;not worth the trouble&quot;.</p><p>FWIW (my stab at a reason for this divide), I think its largely a problem of peers. In the enterprise, you work with great developers and you work with <i>not so great</i> developers. Most of these are fresh college&#x2F;code-bootcamp developers but there are some rare bad experienced developers. At least in the field of building languages (maybe open source in general) you get to be very selective. Essentially, you only get peers who are experts (even if some of them do start off making changes while in college or without any formal education - also keep in mind the selection bias of people curious and motivated to help a project they aren&#x27;t being paid for). Compounded with few strict deadlines, this basically means everyone is on their A-game all the time. eg. &quot;Why would you need metrics about how many lines+branches of code are tested? and you want to potentially fail the build if it doesn&#x27;t meet some threshold?? Some things are hard to test! Shouldn&#x27;t the implementor get to decide how much testing is the appropriate amount of testing?&quot;</p><p>P.S. Please, anyone, correct me where I&#x27;m wrong.

Being out of tree let us iterate quickly. It lets us work on extremely useful lints which as a side effect have false positives (there are a lot of patterns it catches which <i>might</i> be buggy but sometimes have legit use cases that are hard for clippy to detect and ignore). It lets us add controversial lints. In general a separation between the &quot;core&quot; lints (which everyone usually agrees on passing, and cover a small set of bare-minimum issues) and the clippy lints (which not everyone agrees on, and cover a wide range of issues which don&#x27;t always apply to your codebase) is nice to have.</p><p>There are many reasons to not want to run clippy, one of them being that&#x27;s it&#x27;s too strict&#x2F;annoying. In Servo we can&#x27;t run clippy because someone needs to go through it and update Servo over the thousands of warnings clippy produces when run on Servo (many of which are false positives). I occasionally do some of this, but clippy grows pretty quickly too so each time I do it there are new things. (I&#x27;m waiting for rustfix to mature so that I can automate a lot of this).</p><p>So, to me, clippy should be something you have to <i>decide</i> to use.</p><p>We do plan to make clippy part of the rust distribution (bundled with cargo and friends), it&#x27;s just not happened yet since it&#x27;s blocked on a bunch of things.</p><p>Clippy not being part of the default pipeline is just an artifact of its immaturity. It&#x27;s still used by a lot of people despite not getting free publicity from being a default which is promising, though.</p><p>I don&#x27;t see why there&#x27;s much value being assigned to &quot;first class&quot; tooling in Rust. code coverage and clippy are a `cargo install` away.</p><p>&gt;  Most of these are fresh college&#x2F;code-bootcamp developers but there are some rare bad experienced developers</p><p>There are a LOT of new&#x2F;inexperienced programmers in the Rust community. You&#x27;re right that there&#x27;s still some selection bias, but Rust tends to be pretty welcoming. I&#x27;ve mentored people who&#x27;ve only done very basic programming in making Servo pull requests. Some of the sporadic clippy contributors are pretty new to programming.</p><p>&gt; Why would you need metrics about how many lines+branches of code are tested?</p><p>I have never seen opposition to code coverage in Rust in that form. In general folks in Rust are happy to have more kinds of checks lying around.</p><p>It&#x27;s not part of the pipeline mostly because it&#x27;s a cargo install away. If your project needs it, it&#x27;s pretty easy to make it part of your workflow.</p><p>There is an argument to be made that making it part of the pipeline will mean that more people will be driven to use it, which is great. You&#x27;d have to take it up with the tools team and community if you think this is something that needs to happen; I am mostly ambivalent about the idea.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13192527,"story_id":13191129,"children":[{"id":13197159,"created_at_i":1481924676,"type":"comment","author":"yazaddaruvala","text":"<p>Hey sorry, clearly my comment came across as &quot;Rust doesn&#x27;t have X, when it should!&quot;.

A few slow tools doesn&#x27;t mean the whole concept is bad.</p><p>&gt; Why is clippy, like Findbugs, separate from the compiler?</p><p>Rust cares a _lot_ about stability. Adding new lints is extremely difficult, because they can break people&#x27;s builds. Clippy being a separate tool means that they can iterate on lints at a different release cadence than the compiler itself, and aren&#x27;t bound by our mega strict breaking changes policies.</p><p>&gt; In the enterprise, you work with great developers and you work with not so great developers.</p><p>I assure you, it is very much the same in open source. ;)</p><p>So, we do very much care about Rust&#x27;s usage in enterprise scenarios. For example, Mozilla in many ways feels exactly like an enterprise customer of ours. It was a huge amount of technical (and social) work to get to this point, and a lot of that involved negotiating how the builds would actually work. Our perspective is that Cargo is a world-class tool for building code, but that&#x27;s only possible because it&#x27;s focused on _Rust code_. So the strategy should be, how can we best integrate Cargo with these more generic build systems? We&#x27;ve already taken a number of steps forward on this front, and there&#x27;s more to come.</p><p>Most of these features lacking in Cargo are due to a lack of some kind of champion to lay out the specific needs; we don&#x27;t want to just build features and hope they&#x27;re useful. In the past, we&#x27;ve had several people come to us with &quot;here&#x27;s my issue getting Rust in my workplace&quot;, and that experience has been valuable. We&#x27;re a small crew, we need to focus in order to keep shipping quality stuff.

Also you should not forget that Rust is still very young for a programming language so cargo is everything but done. Cargo is more a unified interface combining the compiler and the crates package repository than a full fledged build system. Given the available resources and time for building rust, I thing choosing to (for now) not include a fist class rust coverage system, debugger etc. is a sane choice, especially because all this things are available as external tools (debugger=gdb, coverage=kcov, etc.).</p><p>Also there are discussions&#x2F;issues about enabling the integration with &quot;enterprise&quot; build systems, they just currently don&#x27;t have a high priority and happen mostly in the background. So it&#x27;s probably just a matter of time\nuntil you can use rust with a &quot;enterprise&quot; build system\nlike Bazel.</p><p>Wrt. clippy integration in rust, it is mostly about keeping the compiler smaller and easier to maintain. Through it should be noted, that all &quot;important&quot; lints are in rustc, clippy just provides more useful ones. By keeping both projects separated it is possible to iterate both of them independent of the other. Which can be quite useful in open source development. Also don&#x27;t enterprise systems also have a separate linter? (And no &quot;better code&quot; is not better code for every one, as the definition for what good code is can change quite a bit depending on the person, e.g. wrt. variable shadowing)</p><p>Lastly I don&#x27;t think your reasoning about peers holds, you don&#x27;t really have the choice to be selective about people working on the project, at last not if you have open source project on the scale of rust. Through you might be able to have more strict requirements for code quality. Nevertheless given how rustc catches a lot of possible bugs, and how to community is, I would be surprised if there would not be some less experienced programmers contributing to the compiler. But then at last Mozilla also uses rust in production, so some parts have deadlines and even if not it&#x27;s quite different for them then a `A-game`classification. Also it&#x27;s not so, that you can&#x27;t have metrics about lines&#x2F;branch coverage, failed the build on certain thresholds, etc. It&#x27;s just not necessary a build-in feature, through available nevertheless. Also it would be really strange if a programming language &#x2F; build tool would decide which amount of coverage is ok, it&#x27;s something the project manager&#x2F;programmer has to decide (once) and then configure the build tool to enforce it (I most likely did misunderstood you on the last line ;-) ).</p><p>Ups, I wrote much to much.</p><p>TL;TR: \n1) rust has less (programmer) resources \n2) it&#x27;s still young, tools like cargo, or the testing API are everything but complete.

By that time, Cargo had already been in development for over a year, had reached release 0.1.0, and was already the official build tool for most Rust projects.</p><p>Furthermore, Bazel and Cargo are aimed at slightly different use-cases. Cargo is tailored towards Rust, is integrated with a Rust package repository, and can use it&#x27;s knowledge of Rust to allow for builds of pure-Rust projects with a lot less configuration. Bazel is a more general purpose build system, but that means it requires a little more configuration. There&#x27;s no reason you couldn&#x27;t use Bazel for building a larger project that includes Rust and C, C++, Java, or other languages that need to be built, but Cargo makes it a lot easier and simpler to handle pure-Rust projects than it would be in Bazel.</p><p>Many of the other tools that you mention don&#x27;t require just more support from the build tool, but also significant engineering effort on the part of the compiler, or a separate static analyzer, or other development process tools. These tools are desired, there just isn&#x27;t anyone who has had the time to design and build them.</p><p>As to why Clippy is separate from the compiler, there are a couple of reasons. Adding more lints to the compiler, especially ones that are turned on by default, can cause problems as well. Any time you add a new lint, you may break people&#x27;s code that has #![deny(warnings)] turned on. Even if people don&#x27;t, a lot of people will still try to rewrite code to make it comply with lints; but that in itself can cause problems. I&#x27;ve seen many bugs introduced over the years by people trying to do too many lint cleanups at once, and making mistakes in some of their cleanups. For this reason, the Rust compiler is fairly conservative about adding new lints..</p><p>That said, it sounds like there are plans to integrate Clippy with the compiler and cargo, but probably as an opt-in separate command rather than being included in the default set of warnings: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;rust&#x2F;comments&#x2F;5ibr2a&#x2F;cargo_check_has_been_merged_into_cargo_directly&#x2F;db775vd&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;rust&#x2F;comments&#x2F;5ibr2a&#x2F;cargo_check_ha...</a></p><p>Code coverage is another example. You can use some existing code-coverage tools with Rust (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;users.rust-lang.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;tutorial-how-to-collect-test-coverages-for-rust-project&#x2F;650\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;users.rust-lang.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;tutorial-how-to-collect-test-c...</a>). Because there are tools out there that work, there&#x27;s less of a pressing need to get code coverage integrated with the Rust toolchain; I think that it would be a good idea to do eventually, as it will make it easier to do cross-platform and out of the box, but for now it&#x27;s not the highest priority.</p><p>So, I don&#x27;t think that any of these omissions are due to a difference of philosophy; just a difference of focus. Rust is all about admitting that programmers aren&#x27;t perfect, and that better tooling can help avoid mistakes and thus make developers more productive. Right now, that focus is on things like improving the compiler (adding MIR, which allows for fixing several bugs in the compiler and doing some Rust-specific optimizations before getting to LLVM), implementing the Rust Language Server which can be used as a backend for IDEs, improving the ability of the compiler to do incremental and parallel builds, and adding language features with a focus on making Rust easier to use.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13192527,"story_id":13191129,"children":[{"id":13197162,"created_at_i":1481924693,"type":"comment","author":"yazaddaruvala","text":"<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13197159\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13197159</a></p>","points":null,"parent_id":13194373,"story_id":13191129,"children":[]}]},{"id":13192874,"created_at_i":1481892622,"type":"comment","author":"__s","text":"<p>I&#x27;m on both sides, &amp; I wish on the enterprise side we had what Python has (bugs.python.org &amp; rietveld &amp; good DVCS).
