Both its premises (Skype was peer to peer before MS) and conclusion (MS made it a client-server system because Evil).</p><p>- Real peer to peer on internet is not really possible, since most end users are behind NAT. Skype resorts to a number of hole punching techniques, but really only uses STUN&#x2F;ICE, effectively using super-nodes as relay for sessions. This directly means that all these communication are transiting through a third party, and not peer to peer.</p><p>- Super-nodes used to be regular end users (with some simple algorithm to elect as supernode users with high up-time, high throughput. Fun fact: only windows client users were possible super-nodes). This model proved to be too fragile. In case the network falls down (which happened some years ago), then the super-nodes are no longer available, and get instantly DoS when coming back up due to every other node trying to get back. This is a vicious cycle in which the network cannot get back up. So for a long time now (before MS) super-nodes are just backed by Skype-hosted servers in data-centers.</p><p>- Thin clients are a real thing in e.g. the african market, where a lot of very old phones are still in circulation, no &quot;apps&quot; are possible.

Is it a matter of most cars being mostly empty, or is it inherently impossible to match the mass transit capacity.  If we look at it as passengers carried over space required and time spent, here&#x27;s how I see it:</p><p>Rail mass transit does not as efficiently use the land it&#x27;s on a occupancy basis (there&#x27;s not always a train on a specific square foot of track).  In peak times, cars are more efficient on a <i>vehicle</i> basis.  According to BART system facts[1], there are 107 miles of track.  There are 669 cars, seating for 72 in 448 of them with each being 70 feet (with 59 of them having an additional 5 feet for a cab), and seating for 64 in 230 cars[2] (with an indeterminate car length, so I&#x27;ll use the smaller listed), for a total capacity of 46,976 <i>seated</i> people.  BART states that all cars can hold over 200 people in a &quot;crush&quot; load, so we&#x27;ll assume 200 as the theoretical maximum, and say BART can carry 133,000 people when at peak (crush) capacity, and over the 107 miles of track, that gives us a density of 1,250 people per linear track mile, but with only 8.3% track utilization at any one time.</p><p>Cars do not as efficiently pack people per vehicle usually, but can more efficiently use the roads on a per-vehicle basis.  Assuming very heavy traffic which is not stop-and-go, so perhaps 35 miles an hour average (the same as BART), and a 4-lane highway (two each direction), if each car is allowing two car lengths between itself and the car in front (slow traffic), we have approximately 33% road utilization (or 25%, or 20% depending on what you think the average space between vehicles is).  Since carpooling seems to be at about 10% <i>currently</i> carpooling[4] (ignoring that it may be different in certain arterial routes, as we are discussing), we have around 1.066 people per car[5] as a lower bound.  With an average car length of 177.2 inches[6], or 14.77 feet, we can estimate the people per mile on the highway during this time as being 604 people per mile of 4-lane highway.</p><p>Interesting take-aways for me:</p><p>While 4-lane highways may take more room than rail (not sure the actual sizes here), they are also more versatile.</p><p>If the highway bogs down below 35 mph, it&#x27;s then less than the average rate of BART, and we need to start computing people over time instead of just people over distance.</p><p>BART has much more room to increase track utilization, but there is likely unaccounted for overhead here on each train.  Optimal usage at current speed is one train arriving immediately after the prior one leaving, at 35 mph <i>exact speed</i> and 20 second stops, for a train of six cars (?) and 425 feet, that would be cars 2.42 train lengths apart, and a utilization of 29%, or roughly a 4x increase over current rates,  5,000 people per track-mile.</p><p>Cars have much more room to increase vehicle utilization.  If we replaced 50% of vehicles with full size vans transporting on average 7 people each and didn&#x27;t touch road utilization, we would be at an overall average of 4 people per car, and 2600 people per highway mile.  Interestingly, if we somehow moved towards a system where smaller vehicles picked up and shuttled people with small amounts of sharing to bus-stations where they were sorted into smaller buses (40 people) going specific area depots, and from those depots dispersed again to final destinations using individual cars with small amounts of sharing, we might easily surpass rail transit systems.  averaging 20.5 people per vehicle, but with somewhat more area used should put us close to 10,000 people per highway mile.</p><p>Of course, there&#x27;s a lot of assumptions in all the numbers, and some speculation in the possibilities, but I thought it was interesting to figure out. ;)</p><p>1: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bart.gov&#x2F;about&#x2F;history&#x2F;facts\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bart.gov&#x2F;about&#x2F;history&#x2F;facts</a></p><p>2: I know the total car numbers don&#x27;t add up.

I doubt many work well in even &quot;normal&quot; inclement weather (ie - light rain or snow). The biggest problem is sensors.</p><p>I am not a self-driving car expert (software or hardware). Nor am I an expert in ML, computer vision, etc. But I do have minor experience in each of those. Currently, I am enrolled and taking Udacity&#x27;s new &quot;Self-Driving Car Engineer&quot; nanodegree course. For my cohort (November), we just completed the first basic project - Lane Finding.</p><p>This project utilized Python and OpenCV, and was far from a robust enough system for it to be used on a real vehicle (for one thing, it wasn&#x27;t fast enough - it does well with non-real time video and still photos, but it would likely need to be re-written in C&#x2F;C++ for it to stand a chance in a real-time situation). It couldn&#x27;t deal with curves, and it has other corner cases.</p><p>We had several still pictures to work with, then two required videos, and one bonus &quot;challenge&quot; (ie - extra credit) video. If we had time, we could try our hand with our own videos, etc. It was very easy to get things working with the still images, and the two regular videos. But the challenge video was something else entirely.</p><p>In that video, you had to deal with not only different color lines, but also a section of different color roadway, shadows and varying light conditions. With enough effort and thought, it was easy enough to get things working properly, but it highlighted the fact that humans do some amazing things when they drive.</p><p>For one thing, our eyes are better capable to handle subtle differences in color, shadow, and lighting (particularly brightness and contrast) than most traditional image sensors. Furthermore, we can &quot;fill in gaps&quot; and &quot;infer&quot; where and how things should be, based on other information in the environment. In cases of rain or snow, we can - for instance - watch where other cars go, follow the &quot;tracks&quot; other cars make in front of us, follow road &quot;edges&quot;, and use other subtle cues to help us guide our vehicles as we drive (another instance - recently they repaved the road near my work - but haven&#x27;t painted new lane markings - I and probably others instead used the &quot;seams&quot; between the asphault runs as &quot;lane markers&quot; instead).</p><p>These and many other issues likely are &quot;edge cases&quot; that haven&#x27;t been fully explored in this relatively new cycle in self-driving car engineering. I am confident that the problems will be solved, likely with deep learning systems of varying kinds, as well as better sensors. Sensor data fusion and priority could also help (ie - use a LIDAR to &quot;follow&quot; a car in front of you, perhaps? Of course, filter out the noise of the falling rain&#x2F;snow, first).</p><p>So far, this course has enlightened me more on just how hard of a problem overall self-driving vehicle systems are to solve. Furthermore, there aren&#x27;t many players (companies nor individuals) in the market (which is why I am taking the course - to expand on my current skills). Solving these kinds of hard problems will be paramount for a successful self-driving vehicle to last in the market.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13169405,"story_id":13168888,"children":[{"id":13170210,"created_at_i":1481658493,"type":"comment","author":"ilaksh","text":"<p>Google and Nvidia and maybe Tesla (probably just using Nvidia&#x27;s system) as well as perhaps a few others _have_ solved those prpblems using things like deep learning, LIDAR and sensor fusion.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13169901,"story_id":13168888,"children":[{"id":13170485,"created_at_i":1481659919,"type":"comment","author":"walrus1066","text":"<p>Any references?

This was 1994, and it&#x27;s still hard to do in most development environments compared to the ease of Notes.</p><p>4. Public-Private key identity management and a terrific security model all the way down.  It made it very easy to enforce a very granular security policy across all the apps down to individual rows of data with the same global security mechanism.

I worked at IBM last year. I had, in turns, a frustration, a revulsion, and finally a great admiration for Lotus Notes. Not for any practical reasons—the implementation leaves much to be desired. But in the abstract? It&#x27;s kind of cool.</p><p>See, Lotus Notes is essentially (the modern conception of a) web browser: an MDI navigation chrome, plus rendering engine, plus VM runtime. Each time you open a Notes &quot;document&quot; (like an HTML file), the code embedded in it is run through the VM to create a DOM, which is rendered by the rendering engine and displayed in the window&#x2F;tab representing the document. One of the common DOM element types is a text link, and Notes documents frequently link to other .nsf files, which then are downloaded and which then open in Notes in new windows&#x2F;tabs.</p><p>The one crucial thing that Notes has over web-browsers, though, that made all the difference in how the two ended up evolving, is that in Notes, each Notes document has a <i>remote</i> database associated with it, that <i>the document</i> can read from and write to.</p><p>It&#x27;s a bit like a site or mobile app that uses Parse or Firebase: there&#x27;s no need to write backend logic; you just write your client, and then point it at a <i>generic</i> app backing-store server. In this case, the backing-store server is called Lotus Domino.</p><p>Like Parse or Firebase, Domino handles authenticating clients. For each Domino server a Notes client is signed into, they have an &quot;identity file&quot; (PGP keypair) the server recognizes as &quot;them&quot;, and which their Notes client uses to sign any documents it authors (where an update sent by a document to a Domino server is sent as a small signed document.)</p><p>This is in a lot of ways similar to how browsers use TLS client certificates, but lighter-weight, in a similar way to how e.g. an Apt repository&#x27;s pre-signed packages are lighter-weight than HTTPS. In TLS, a piece of data will lose its origin once it passes out the other end of a TLS tunnel, and so the server must make a metadata record of who it was talking to, and vouch for the data <i>itself</i> (with another TLS tunnel) when someone else requests it. With pre-signed documents, the server can be a dumb store-and-forward server, and the documents will always just &quot;stay&quot; signed by whoever first created them, without needing un-wrapping and re-wrapping on every transmission.</p><p>And <i>that</i> means that, unlike Parse or Firebase where linearization is done on the server, a Notes document can just download all the store-and-fowarded update message-documents representing its database, and then linearize them itself, using the Notes client&#x27;s own configured trust settings to decide what operations in the event stream were authorized changes, and then the document&#x27;s own merge policies to decide how to linearize the data (i.e. what fields are CRDTs, what fields are last-write-wins, etc.)</p><p>Then, finally, you can understand what is going on when Lotus Notes opens up and shows you what looks to be an email client: it&#x27;s a Notes document (like a web-app) syncing down a Domino database full of signed update-messages from other Notes clients (one of which can be an SMTP gateway server, allowing messages to get pushed in from outside the Notes system.) The email client document <i>chooses</i> to represent its (considered-authorized) update-messages as individual email messages in a list—but some of them are also other things, like e.g. edits to previously-sent messages.</p><p>Each signed update-message might just contain a plaintext message, or it might effectively be a publish-event pointing the Notes client at a Notes document. The email-client document is responsible for deciding how to render the plaintext messages when you focus those; but if you focus a message representing a reference to a Notes document, it just downloads&#x2F;syncs that Notes document into your local database and then the preview pane displays it in the Notes equivalent of an &lt;iframe&gt;, allowing it to run all its own code.</p><p>So, you could picture the default Lotus Notes email client as being less like Gmail, and more like Slack: it syncs a history of update-messages, some of which are modification-events for real &quot;messages&quot;. Like Slack, you can upload files &quot;to the service&quot; and then just send references to them to other users in your team. And some of these files could be small, self-contained HTML5 apps, talking to a service like Firebase.</p><p>The key differences, then, are that 1. you actually interact with such documents <i>within</i> the client (so, picture if you could post HTML documents into Slack that would be displayed <i>as an &lt;iframe&gt;</i>); and 2. the messaging service itself is hosting the Firebase-alike functionality, such that every &quot;app&quot; built with the Firebase-alike functionality gets an implicit User model mapped to the user of the messaging app.</p><p>When described like that, it actually sounds a bit <i>less</i> braindead than Google Wave, doesn&#x27;t it?</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13168969,"story_id":13168969,"children":[]},{"id":13171189,"created_at_i":1481664258,"type":"comment","author":"cha-cho","text":"<p>I would be interested to see the original spec for Lotus Agenda.

On the plus side, its open-ended, fully customizable document database is a phenomenally powerful tool for creating information management systems that map very closely to the unique workflows and structures that arise in any business. As an expression of the promise of office automation, it&#x27;s pretty compelling.</p><p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s the world&#x27;s worst email &amp; calendar client and much of its bad reputation stems from users having to put up with that when there&#x27;s really no need for it ever to have been installed.

It&#x27;s a very powerful tool, but a dangerous one too: I saw a telecoms company in the late 90s&#x2F;early 2000s blow up partly because it relied too heavily on a custom Notes solution that became prohibitively expensive to change as the business evolved. Management got hooked on formalizing all their business processes inside Notes, seduced by the promise of total transparency and operational control. The system got big, and Notes scales badly. Reporting runs that took a few minutes with a few hundred attributed documents in 1998 took over four hours by 2000; I helped put in a SQL Server instance to create a relationally structured copy of the unstructured attributed documents to reduce that time, but of course that was more money. The poor chap that owned the company ended up having a stroke and the company was wound down. That&#x27;s an anecdote, but on the other two occasions I&#x27;ve seen Notes used for its real value (as a document DB with associated processes) it&#x27;s ended up in a similar, sprawling and unmaintainable end state.</p><p>I guess one way to think of it is as a kind of Excel for processes and documents. End users can do things with it very easily - you can set stuff up that exactly reflects the flow of information and control processes unique to a business, and that&#x27;s a great tool for helping a business mature and control its operational risks - but its limitations and the systemic risk it introduces are not well understood and only become apparent when you&#x27;ve gone too far with it.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13168969,"story_id":13168969,"children":[{"id":13170213,"created_at_i":1481658506,"type":"comment","author":"k__","text":"<p>I come from 7years with the email&#x2F;cal-client.</p><p>Even gmail, which is quite outdated today , beat this thing...</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13170174,"story_id":13168969,"children":[]},{"id":13170228,"created_at_i":1481658567,"type":"comment","author":"EvanAnderson","text":"<p>I really like how you characterize it as &quot;Excel for processes and documents&quot;.

Most conventional VoIP (in North America) uses G.711µ, whose purpose is to provide the IP correlate to logarithmically companded PCM encoding used in a normal DS0 (digital PSTN loop carrier).</p><p>DS0s are not compressed. Logarithmic steps result in some approximation, but that has more to do with the mechanics of digital sampling and quantisation than bandwidth savings. In fact, G.711µ is an uncompressed 64 Kbps codec, exactly equivalent to the synchronous data rate of a DS0 in the circuit-switched world. This is in sharp contrast to codecs like G.729, which, to simplify things, use waveform translation tables to achieve significant compression (down to about 8 Kbps in the case of G.729 specifically). Some less patent-encumbered variants do similar things.</p><p>The frequency response is limited by the standard PSTN bearer channel range of ~3.1 KHz, which is for historical reasons. That was the most frequency response one could reliably squeeze out of copper analog lines, for both physical and economic reasons tied up in the history of the telephone system. Since the primary concern of the VoIP industry was—and still is—interoperation with the traditional telephone network (PSTN, or Publicly Switched Telephone Network), adopting codecs which translate readily into that world with a minimum of CPU-hungry transcoding and reframing makes sense.</p><p>WebRTC, as a peer-to-peer multimedia calling mechanism intended to resemble something like Skype, is more purely a product of Internet-orientated thinking and has a rather post-PSTN mindset. WebRTC endpoints, like IP phones supporting wide-band codecs (e.g. G.722), are not constrained by the requirement to talk to the old-school telephone network.

In Slack, messages ordering sometimes changes sometimes after I have received two messages, that are then ordered differently.

This eliminates any manual replay. Slack does not do this, apparently, even though unexpected network termination happens frequently.</p><p>A third defiency of Slack that makes it look like IRC is the notable absense of metadata fields.

I&#x27;ve been exploring the world with radio since long before the WWW was invented. I used to carry a shortwave radio with me wherever I traveled back in the 1970s and 80s. I would lie there in the dark in Japan listening to the broadcasts out of North Korean screeching about the &quot;Great Leader&quot; (Kim Il-sung) or in Thailand listening to the Khmer Rouge (whom I couldn&#x27;t understand, but I knew who controlled Cambodian broadcasts) or in the UK listening to Africans (not putting on a show for Americans but putting on a show for their own people) or on the East Coast of the US listening to callers to talk shows in the UK arguing about local issues.

And a couple of days ago, I found something for my father out in the desert a thousand miles from here by using Google Street View to &quot;drive&quot; down a remote highway, looking around until I found it.

The first step to building good products is to understand how people use them.</p><p>Wireless headphones are about as stupid as wireless Internet.</p><p>Just like wired Internet, wired headphones will continue to have a place for people who need certain capabilities or ruggedness or etc., but for most people, wireless headphones are the way to go. Let me walk you through some of the advantages:</p><p>1. Working out. Wired headphones constantly get caught on things and sometimes get violently ripped from your ears. \n2. Related to point one, any activity or job where you could risk a loose wire being caught is perfect for wireless headphones. It very well may be significantly safer. \n3. Wireless headphones have bigger range than wires. You don&#x27;t have to place your phone in your pants pockets, for instance, to use wireless headphones. You could even have your phone in your bag, and everything will still work. Much of women&#x27;s fashion either has no pockets or pockets of little value. This is a major reason women carry around purses. But you can&#x27;t use headphones with a phone in your purse, hence why women are often physically carrying their phones in your hands. With wireless headphones, they can keep their phone in their purse or jacket and still listen to music or respond to calls. \n5. Or if you are doing something around the house, you don&#x27;t always have to have your headphones on you at all times. This could be particularly useful if you are doing something like washing a car where you might get your pants wet and don&#x27;t want to have your phone on you.\n6. With this new class of wireless earbuds that are small and lightweight, you could keep one of two of them in much of your day to answer phone calls or ask Siri or Google questions.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13169937,"story_id":13169831,"children":[{"id":13173942,"created_at_i":1481691259,"type":"comment","author":"sooheon","text":"<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with any of those points.

Currently (and rather unintuitively, considering that ML is an applied optimization field, and optimization is usually concerned with underfitting), the bane of ML is overfitting. It&#x27;s easy to supply a model with high representational capacity, but it&#x27;s impossible to learn anything interesting in a reasonable amount of time. You&#x27;ll learn how to fit your training set perfectly because your model has enough degrees of freedom to let you fit a million points arbitrarily well, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that the resulting fit describes the data in a meaningful way. This is why a core tenet of ML is to prune parameters whenever possible. Neurogenesis increases representational capacity whenever it detects that your underlying model does not have sufficient representational capacity to fit the data; from this perspective, you start small (undercapacity) and then you gradually increase your capacity until you hit the optimal model. In other words, Neurogenesis is also a way for you to minimize the number of options.</p><p>On the other hand, giving the model with more options than it necessarily needs and letting it decide what is important will usually backfire. Rather than learning a few meaningful&#x2F;functional features, it can just go ahead and completely fit the training data from the very beginning.

These methods have arguably had their strongest impact on tasks such as image and audio processing - areas where humans have always performed better than conventional algorithms. In contrast to biological neural systems, which are capable of learning continuously, deep artificial networks have a limited ability for incorporating new information after a network has been trained. As a result, continuous learning methods could be very helpful in allowing deep networks to handle data sets which change over time. Here, inspired by the process of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, we investigate how adding new neurons to artificial neural networks can allow them to acquire new information, while preserving what they have already learned. Our results on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and the NIST SD 19 dataset, which includes lower and upper case letters and digits, show that neurogenesis looks like a good approach for tackling the &quot;stability-plasticity dilemma&quot; that has been a problem for adaptive machine learning algorithms for some time.</p><p>As an academic, I tend to agree that we frequently feel compelled to apply more verbosity than is strictly required in order to communicate the intended semantic constructs.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13172473,"story_id":13171883,"children":[{"id":13174057,"created_at_i":1481692942,"type":"comment","author":"SubiculumCode","text":"<p>Academic writing avoids using periods.

This is a single paper about a technique for adding neurons to ANNs over time, and it is only one of many over the last few decades.
