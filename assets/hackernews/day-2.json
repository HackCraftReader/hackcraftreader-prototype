Both its premises (Skype was peer to peer before MS) and conclusion (MS made it a client-server system because Evil).</p><p>- Real peer to peer on internet is not really possible, since most end users are behind NAT. Skype resorts to a number of hole punching techniques, but really only uses STUN&#x2F;ICE, effectively using super-nodes as relay for sessions. This directly means that all these communication are transiting through a third party, and not peer to peer.</p><p>- Super-nodes used to be regular end users (with some simple algorithm to elect as supernode users with high up-time, high throughput. Fun fact: only windows client users were possible super-nodes). This model proved to be too fragile. In case the network falls down (which happened some years ago), then the super-nodes are no longer available, and get instantly DoS when coming back up due to every other node trying to get back. This is a vicious cycle in which the network cannot get back up. So for a long time now (before MS) super-nodes are just backed by Skype-hosted servers in data-centers.</p><p>- Thin clients are a real thing in e.g. the african market, where a lot of very old phones are still in circulation, no &quot;apps&quot; are possible.

Is it a matter of most cars being mostly empty, or is it inherently impossible to match the mass transit capacity.  If we look at it as passengers carried over space required and time spent, here&#x27;s how I see it:</p><p>Rail mass transit does not as efficiently use the land it&#x27;s on a occupancy basis (there&#x27;s not always a train on a specific square foot of track).  In peak times, cars are more efficient on a <i>vehicle</i> basis.  According to BART system facts[1], there are 107 miles of track.  There are 669 cars, seating for 72 in 448 of them with each being 70 feet (with 59 of them having an additional 5 feet for a cab), and seating for 64 in 230 cars[2] (with an indeterminate car length, so I&#x27;ll use the smaller listed), for a total capacity of 46,976 <i>seated</i> people.  BART states that all cars can hold over 200 people in a &quot;crush&quot; load, so we&#x27;ll assume 200 as the theoretical maximum, and say BART can carry 133,000 people when at peak (crush) capacity, and over the 107 miles of track, that gives us a density of 1,250 people per linear track mile, but with only 8.3% track utilization at any one time.</p><p>Cars do not as efficiently pack people per vehicle usually, but can more efficiently use the roads on a per-vehicle basis.  Assuming very heavy traffic which is not stop-and-go, so perhaps 35 miles an hour average (the same as BART), and a 4-lane highway (two each direction), if each car is allowing two car lengths between itself and the car in front (slow traffic), we have approximately 33% road utilization (or 25%, or 20% depending on what you think the average space between vehicles is).  Since carpooling seems to be at about 10% <i>currently</i> carpooling[4] (ignoring that it may be different in certain arterial routes, as we are discussing), we have around 1.066 people per car[5] as a lower bound.  With an average car length of 177.2 inches[6], or 14.77 feet, we can estimate the people per mile on the highway during this time as being 604 people per mile of 4-lane highway.</p><p>Interesting take-aways for me:</p><p>While 4-lane highways may take more room than rail (not sure the actual sizes here), they are also more versatile.</p><p>If the highway bogs down below 35 mph, it&#x27;s then less than the average rate of BART, and we need to start computing people over time instead of just people over distance.</p><p>BART has much more room to increase track utilization, but there is likely unaccounted for overhead here on each train.  Optimal usage at current speed is one train arriving immediately after the prior one leaving, at 35 mph <i>exact speed</i> and 20 second stops, for a train of six cars (?) and 425 feet, that would be cars 2.42 train lengths apart, and a utilization of 29%, or roughly a 4x increase over current rates,  5,000 people per track-mile.</p><p>Cars have much more room to increase vehicle utilization.  If we replaced 50% of vehicles with full size vans transporting on average 7 people each and didn&#x27;t touch road utilization, we would be at an overall average of 4 people per car, and 2600 people per highway mile.  Interestingly, if we somehow moved towards a system where smaller vehicles picked up and shuttled people with small amounts of sharing to bus-stations where they were sorted into smaller buses (40 people) going specific area depots, and from those depots dispersed again to final destinations using individual cars with small amounts of sharing, we might easily surpass rail transit systems.  averaging 20.5 people per vehicle, but with somewhat more area used should put us close to 10,000 people per highway mile.</p><p>Of course, there&#x27;s a lot of assumptions in all the numbers, and some speculation in the possibilities, but I thought it was interesting to figure out. ;)</p><p>1: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bart.gov&#x2F;about&#x2F;history&#x2F;facts\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bart.gov&#x2F;about&#x2F;history&#x2F;facts</a></p><p>2: I know the total car numbers don&#x27;t add up.

I doubt many work well in even &quot;normal&quot; inclement weather (ie - light rain or snow). The biggest problem is sensors.</p><p>I am not a self-driving car expert (software or hardware). Nor am I an expert in ML, computer vision, etc. But I do have minor experience in each of those. Currently, I am enrolled and taking Udacity&#x27;s new &quot;Self-Driving Car Engineer&quot; nanodegree course. For my cohort (November), we just completed the first basic project - Lane Finding.</p><p>This project utilized Python and OpenCV, and was far from a robust enough system for it to be used on a real vehicle (for one thing, it wasn&#x27;t fast enough - it does well with non-real time video and still photos, but it would likely need to be re-written in C&#x2F;C++ for it to stand a chance in a real-time situation). It couldn&#x27;t deal with curves, and it has other corner cases.</p><p>We had several still pictures to work with, then two required videos, and one bonus &quot;challenge&quot; (ie - extra credit) video. If we had time, we could try our hand with our own videos, etc. It was very easy to get things working with the still images, and the two regular videos. But the challenge video was something else entirely.</p><p>In that video, you had to deal with not only different color lines, but also a section of different color roadway, shadows and varying light conditions. With enough effort and thought, it was easy enough to get things working properly, but it highlighted the fact that humans do some amazing things when they drive.</p><p>For one thing, our eyes are better capable to handle subtle differences in color, shadow, and lighting (particularly brightness and contrast) than most traditional image sensors. Furthermore, we can &quot;fill in gaps&quot; and &quot;infer&quot; where and how things should be, based on other information in the environment. In cases of rain or snow, we can - for instance - watch where other cars go, follow the &quot;tracks&quot; other cars make in front of us, follow road &quot;edges&quot;, and use other subtle cues to help us guide our vehicles as we drive (another instance - recently they repaved the road near my work - but haven&#x27;t painted new lane markings - I and probably others instead used the &quot;seams&quot; between the asphault runs as &quot;lane markers&quot; instead).</p><p>These and many other issues likely are &quot;edge cases&quot; that haven&#x27;t been fully explored in this relatively new cycle in self-driving car engineering. I am confident that the problems will be solved, likely with deep learning systems of varying kinds, as well as better sensors. Sensor data fusion and priority could also help (ie - use a LIDAR to &quot;follow&quot; a car in front of you, perhaps? Of course, filter out the noise of the falling rain&#x2F;snow, first).</p><p>So far, this course has enlightened me more on just how hard of a problem overall self-driving vehicle systems are to solve. Furthermore, there aren&#x27;t many players (companies nor individuals) in the market (which is why I am taking the course - to expand on my current skills). Solving these kinds of hard problems will be paramount for a successful self-driving vehicle to last in the market.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13169405,"story_id":13168888,"children":[{"id":13170210,"created_at_i":1481658493,"type":"comment","author":"ilaksh","text":"<p>Google and Nvidia and maybe Tesla (probably just using Nvidia&#x27;s system) as well as perhaps a few others _have_ solved those prpblems using things like deep learning, LIDAR and sensor fusion.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13169901,"story_id":13168888,"children":[{"id":13170485,"created_at_i":1481659919,"type":"comment","author":"walrus1066","text":"<p>Any references?

This was 1994, and it&#x27;s still hard to do in most development environments compared to the ease of Notes.</p><p>4. Public-Private key identity management and a terrific security model all the way down.  It made it very easy to enforce a very granular security policy across all the apps down to individual rows of data with the same global security mechanism.

I worked at IBM last year. I had, in turns, a frustration, a revulsion, and finally a great admiration for Lotus Notes. Not for any practical reasons—the implementation leaves much to be desired. But in the abstract? It&#x27;s kind of cool.</p><p>See, Lotus Notes is essentially (the modern conception of a) web browser: an MDI navigation chrome, plus rendering engine, plus VM runtime. Each time you open a Notes &quot;document&quot; (like an HTML file), the code embedded in it is run through the VM to create a DOM, which is rendered by the rendering engine and displayed in the window&#x2F;tab representing the document. One of the common DOM element types is a text link, and Notes documents frequently link to other .nsf files, which then are downloaded and which then open in Notes in new windows&#x2F;tabs.</p><p>The one crucial thing that Notes has over web-browsers, though, that made all the difference in how the two ended up evolving, is that in Notes, each Notes document has a <i>remote</i> database associated with it, that <i>the document</i> can read from and write to.</p><p>It&#x27;s a bit like a site or mobile app that uses Parse or Firebase: there&#x27;s no need to write backend logic; you just write your client, and then point it at a <i>generic</i> app backing-store server. In this case, the backing-store server is called Lotus Domino.</p><p>Like Parse or Firebase, Domino handles authenticating clients. For each Domino server a Notes client is signed into, they have an &quot;identity file&quot; (PGP keypair) the server recognizes as &quot;them&quot;, and which their Notes client uses to sign any documents it authors (where an update sent by a document to a Domino server is sent as a small signed document.)</p><p>This is in a lot of ways similar to how browsers use TLS client certificates, but lighter-weight, in a similar way to how e.g. an Apt repository&#x27;s pre-signed packages are lighter-weight than HTTPS. In TLS, a piece of data will lose its origin once it passes out the other end of a TLS tunnel, and so the server must make a metadata record of who it was talking to, and vouch for the data <i>itself</i> (with another TLS tunnel) when someone else requests it. With pre-signed documents, the server can be a dumb store-and-forward server, and the documents will always just &quot;stay&quot; signed by whoever first created them, without needing un-wrapping and re-wrapping on every transmission.</p><p>And <i>that</i> means that, unlike Parse or Firebase where linearization is done on the server, a Notes document can just download all the store-and-fowarded update message-documents representing its database, and then linearize them itself, using the Notes client&#x27;s own configured trust settings to decide what operations in the event stream were authorized changes, and then the document&#x27;s own merge policies to decide how to linearize the data (i.e. what fields are CRDTs, what fields are last-write-wins, etc.)</p><p>Then, finally, you can understand what is going on when Lotus Notes opens up and shows you what looks to be an email client: it&#x27;s a Notes document (like a web-app) syncing down a Domino database full of signed update-messages from other Notes clients (one of which can be an SMTP gateway server, allowing messages to get pushed in from outside the Notes system.) The email client document <i>chooses</i> to represent its (considered-authorized) update-messages as individual email messages in a list—but some of them are also other things, like e.g. edits to previously-sent messages.</p><p>Each signed update-message might just contain a plaintext message, or it might effectively be a publish-event pointing the Notes client at a Notes document. The email-client document is responsible for deciding how to render the plaintext messages when you focus those; but if you focus a message representing a reference to a Notes document, it just downloads&#x2F;syncs that Notes document into your local database and then the preview pane displays it in the Notes equivalent of an &lt;iframe&gt;, allowing it to run all its own code.</p><p>So, you could picture the default Lotus Notes email client as being less like Gmail, and more like Slack: it syncs a history of update-messages, some of which are modification-events for real &quot;messages&quot;. Like Slack, you can upload files &quot;to the service&quot; and then just send references to them to other users in your team. And some of these files could be small, self-contained HTML5 apps, talking to a service like Firebase.</p><p>The key differences, then, are that 1. you actually interact with such documents <i>within</i> the client (so, picture if you could post HTML documents into Slack that would be displayed <i>as an &lt;iframe&gt;</i>); and 2. the messaging service itself is hosting the Firebase-alike functionality, such that every &quot;app&quot; built with the Firebase-alike functionality gets an implicit User model mapped to the user of the messaging app.</p><p>When described like that, it actually sounds a bit <i>less</i> braindead than Google Wave, doesn&#x27;t it?</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13168969,"story_id":13168969,"children":[]},{"id":13171189,"created_at_i":1481664258,"type":"comment","author":"cha-cho","text":"<p>I would be interested to see the original spec for Lotus Agenda.

On the plus side, its open-ended, fully customizable document database is a phenomenally powerful tool for creating information management systems that map very closely to the unique workflows and structures that arise in any business. As an expression of the promise of office automation, it&#x27;s pretty compelling.</p><p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s the world&#x27;s worst email &amp; calendar client and much of its bad reputation stems from users having to put up with that when there&#x27;s really no need for it ever to have been installed.

It&#x27;s a very powerful tool, but a dangerous one too: I saw a telecoms company in the late 90s&#x2F;early 2000s blow up partly because it relied too heavily on a custom Notes solution that became prohibitively expensive to change as the business evolved. Management got hooked on formalizing all their business processes inside Notes, seduced by the promise of total transparency and operational control. The system got big, and Notes scales badly. Reporting runs that took a few minutes with a few hundred attributed documents in 1998 took over four hours by 2000; I helped put in a SQL Server instance to create a relationally structured copy of the unstructured attributed documents to reduce that time, but of course that was more money. The poor chap that owned the company ended up having a stroke and the company was wound down. That&#x27;s an anecdote, but on the other two occasions I&#x27;ve seen Notes used for its real value (as a document DB with associated processes) it&#x27;s ended up in a similar, sprawling and unmaintainable end state.</p><p>I guess one way to think of it is as a kind of Excel for processes and documents. End users can do things with it very easily - you can set stuff up that exactly reflects the flow of information and control processes unique to a business, and that&#x27;s a great tool for helping a business mature and control its operational risks - but its limitations and the systemic risk it introduces are not well understood and only become apparent when you&#x27;ve gone too far with it.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13168969,"story_id":13168969,"children":[{"id":13170213,"created_at_i":1481658506,"type":"comment","author":"k__","text":"<p>I come from 7years with the email&#x2F;cal-client.</p><p>Even gmail, which is quite outdated today , beat this thing...</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13170174,"story_id":13168969,"children":[]},{"id":13170228,"created_at_i":1481658567,"type":"comment","author":"EvanAnderson","text":"<p>I really like how you characterize it as &quot;Excel for processes and documents&quot;.

Most conventional VoIP (in North America) uses G.711µ, whose purpose is to provide the IP correlate to logarithmically companded PCM encoding used in a normal DS0 (digital PSTN loop carrier).</p><p>DS0s are not compressed. Logarithmic steps result in some approximation, but that has more to do with the mechanics of digital sampling and quantisation than bandwidth savings. In fact, G.711µ is an uncompressed 64 Kbps codec, exactly equivalent to the synchronous data rate of a DS0 in the circuit-switched world. This is in sharp contrast to codecs like G.729, which, to simplify things, use waveform translation tables to achieve significant compression (down to about 8 Kbps in the case of G.729 specifically). Some less patent-encumbered variants do similar things.</p><p>The frequency response is limited by the standard PSTN bearer channel range of ~3.1 KHz, which is for historical reasons. That was the most frequency response one could reliably squeeze out of copper analog lines, for both physical and economic reasons tied up in the history of the telephone system. Since the primary concern of the VoIP industry was—and still is—interoperation with the traditional telephone network (PSTN, or Publicly Switched Telephone Network), adopting codecs which translate readily into that world with a minimum of CPU-hungry transcoding and reframing makes sense.</p><p>WebRTC, as a peer-to-peer multimedia calling mechanism intended to resemble something like Skype, is more purely a product of Internet-orientated thinking and has a rather post-PSTN mindset. WebRTC endpoints, like IP phones supporting wide-band codecs (e.g. G.722), are not constrained by the requirement to talk to the old-school telephone network.

In Slack, messages ordering sometimes changes sometimes after I have received two messages, that are then ordered differently.

This eliminates any manual replay. Slack does not do this, apparently, even though unexpected network termination happens frequently.</p><p>A third defiency of Slack that makes it look like IRC is the notable absense of metadata fields.

I&#x27;ve been exploring the world with radio since long before the WWW was invented. I used to carry a shortwave radio with me wherever I traveled back in the 1970s and 80s. I would lie there in the dark in Japan listening to the broadcasts out of North Korean screeching about the &quot;Great Leader&quot; (Kim Il-sung) or in Thailand listening to the Khmer Rouge (whom I couldn&#x27;t understand, but I knew who controlled Cambodian broadcasts) or in the UK listening to Africans (not putting on a show for Americans but putting on a show for their own people) or on the East Coast of the US listening to callers to talk shows in the UK arguing about local issues.

And a couple of days ago, I found something for my father out in the desert a thousand miles from here by using Google Street View to &quot;drive&quot; down a remote highway, looking around until I found it.

The first step to building good products is to understand how people use them.</p><p>Wireless headphones are about as stupid as wireless Internet.</p><p>Just like wired Internet, wired headphones will continue to have a place for people who need certain capabilities or ruggedness or etc., but for most people, wireless headphones are the way to go. Let me walk you through some of the advantages:</p><p>1. Working out. Wired headphones constantly get caught on things and sometimes get violently ripped from your ears. \n2. Related to point one, any activity or job where you could risk a loose wire being caught is perfect for wireless headphones. It very well may be significantly safer. \n3. Wireless headphones have bigger range than wires. You don&#x27;t have to place your phone in your pants pockets, for instance, to use wireless headphones. You could even have your phone in your bag, and everything will still work. Much of women&#x27;s fashion either has no pockets or pockets of little value. This is a major reason women carry around purses. But you can&#x27;t use headphones with a phone in your purse, hence why women are often physically carrying their phones in your hands. With wireless headphones, they can keep their phone in their purse or jacket and still listen to music or respond to calls. \n5. Or if you are doing something around the house, you don&#x27;t always have to have your headphones on you at all times. This could be particularly useful if you are doing something like washing a car where you might get your pants wet and don&#x27;t want to have your phone on you.\n6. With this new class of wireless earbuds that are small and lightweight, you could keep one of two of them in much of your day to answer phone calls or ask Siri or Google questions.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13169937,"story_id":13169831,"children":[{"id":13173942,"created_at_i":1481691259,"type":"comment","author":"sooheon","text":"<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with any of those points.

Currently (and rather unintuitively, considering that ML is an applied optimization field, and optimization is usually concerned with underfitting), the bane of ML is overfitting. It&#x27;s easy to supply a model with high representational capacity, but it&#x27;s impossible to learn anything interesting in a reasonable amount of time. You&#x27;ll learn how to fit your training set perfectly because your model has enough degrees of freedom to let you fit a million points arbitrarily well, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that the resulting fit describes the data in a meaningful way. This is why a core tenet of ML is to prune parameters whenever possible. Neurogenesis increases representational capacity whenever it detects that your underlying model does not have sufficient representational capacity to fit the data; from this perspective, you start small (undercapacity) and then you gradually increase your capacity until you hit the optimal model. In other words, Neurogenesis is also a way for you to minimize the number of options.</p><p>On the other hand, giving the model with more options than it necessarily needs and letting it decide what is important will usually backfire. Rather than learning a few meaningful&#x2F;functional features, it can just go ahead and completely fit the training data from the very beginning.

These methods have arguably had their strongest impact on tasks such as image and audio processing - areas where humans have always performed better than conventional algorithms. In contrast to biological neural systems, which are capable of learning continuously, deep artificial networks have a limited ability for incorporating new information after a network has been trained. As a result, continuous learning methods could be very helpful in allowing deep networks to handle data sets which change over time. Here, inspired by the process of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, we investigate how adding new neurons to artificial neural networks can allow them to acquire new information, while preserving what they have already learned. Our results on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and the NIST SD 19 dataset, which includes lower and upper case letters and digits, show that neurogenesis looks like a good approach for tackling the &quot;stability-plasticity dilemma&quot; that has been a problem for adaptive machine learning algorithms for some time.</p><p>As an academic, I tend to agree that we frequently feel compelled to apply more verbosity than is strictly required in order to communicate the intended semantic constructs.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13172473,"story_id":13171883,"children":[{"id":13174057,"created_at_i":1481692942,"type":"comment","author":"SubiculumCode","text":"<p>Academic writing avoids using periods.

I believe AMD will compensate for this the same way it has, historically: by selling CPUs with a higher core count. This puts AMD at an intrinsic margin disadvantage, which is made worse by the fact that AMD is fabless whereas Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) runs its own factories (so AMD loses the foundry margin as well).\n    I also think AMD got way ahead of itself. In my last article, titled &quot;Advanced Micro Devices: Then And Now&quot;, I explained this by showing AMD&#x27;s behavior versus how it behaved during 2 extraordinary past events: the launch of the original Athlon and original Opteron. In both those instances AMD stepped ahead of Intel while with Zen AMD is only expected to get close to Intel. Still, in both of those instances AMD had nothing like the present run going into those launches.\n    While I am negative on AMD, I am not negative enough to sell it short. I don&#x27;t think the timing is right for such a move. I also think that there&#x27;s the chance Zen gets &quot;close enough&quot; even if it underperforms, allowing for substantial share gains while selling at a discount. Thus, before considering selling short AMD, I&#x27;m waiting to see how Zen actually performs.\n</code></pre>\nWith that being put out of the way, I&#x27;m writing this article because I think the prior one didn&#x27;t quite filter through. From the comments, one would guess that the message &quot;AMD is much more speculative going into Zen than going into Athlon or Opteron&quot; didn&#x27;t register. The criticism was far and wide, including such things as:</p><p><pre><code>    This time is different because the market is larger.\n    This time AMD is different because it also has GPUs and custom silicon and whatnot.\n    That&#x27;s only share price (it was an adjusted share price …), not market capitalization.\n    AMD was thought to go bankrupt this time, and back in 1999 or 2003 that wasn&#x27;t the case.\n    Etc, etc.\n</code></pre>\nWell, I feel I need to give some more detail here. This detail will show that sentiment today is even more extraordinary than what the previous charts showed. So here we go.</p><p>Revenues, Now And Then</p><p>Over the last 12 months, AMD has produced $4.24 billion in revenues. For 2017, including the early Zen launch, expectations are for $4.55 billion in revenues. Now, remember:</p><p><pre><code>    This includes Zen.\n    This includes GPUs.\n    This includes custom solutions (consoles, etc).\n</code></pre>\nWhy is this revenue number relevant? Consider the following regarding the past two episodes I mentioned:</p><p><pre><code>    Athlon. In 2000, AMD had revenues of $4.64 billion.\n    Opteron. In 2004, AMD had revenues of $5.0 billion.\n</code></pre>\nIn short, AMD&#x27;s revenues were larger in both those years, versus those expected for 2017 including Zen. This includes Zen, GPUs and everything else, thus rendering the arguments that AMD is &quot;much more&quot; today completely moot.</p><p>Market Capitalization, Now And Then</p><p>In my previous article I compared just the relative share prices going into product launches. Of course, AMD has had many losses and M&amp;A (acquiring ATI) throughout the years. This naturally led to a much higher share count today, versus what it was back in 1999&#x2F;2003. How much higher?</p><p><pre><code>    As of the last 10-Q, AMD reported a diluted share count of 815 million shares. Potentially, the actual diluted count is over 1 billion shares (diluted shares for the quarter don&#x27;t include all potential dilution because AMD reported a loss).\n    As of 1999 year-end, AMD had a diluted share count of 294.6 million shares.\n    As of 2003 year-end, AMD had a diluted share count of 346.9 million shares.\n</code></pre>\nNow consider the following:</p><p><pre><code>    After the current run, AMD sits at $10.75. This gives it a market capitalization of around $10.75 billion.\n    When AMD released the Athlon, the stock stood at $9.58. This gave it a market capitalization of around $2.82 billion.\n    When AMD released the Opteron, the stock stood at $8.47. This gave it a market capitalization of around $2.94 billion.\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s easy to see that AMD&#x27;s market cap today is wildly higher than what it was back then (1999, 2003). That is, while the share price isn&#x27;t much different, due to the share count AMD today is valued at a significant multiple of AMD right before either the Athlon or Opteron were launched.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>From this exercise we see that:</p><p><pre><code>    AMD today is expected to have lower revenues when it starts selling Zen, versus the revenues it reached when it was selling the Athlon and Opteron. Perhaps estimates will be revised higher. Perhaps even much higher. But the present estimates are factually lower than what was attained back then.\n    Yet, at the same time, AMD goes for a market capitalization that&#x27;s 3.6-3.8x higher than it was back then, going into the Zen launch.\n</code></pre>\nThus, it isn&#x27;t hard to conclude that the AMD of today is massively more speculative than the AMD of either 1999 or 2003. All the arguments that it has more products now are also rather irrelevant when we consider that today&#x27;s AMD is still expected to be smaller than the AMD which resulted from those past (successful) launches. Never mind that we&#x27;re comparing numbers after a verified success (1999, 2003), to an uncertain success (2017).</p><p>Finally, yes, AMD is more diversified today. However, AMD isn&#x27;t potentially more profitable because back in 1999&#x2F;2003 it controlled its own foundry and now it doesn&#x27;t. Instead, right now AMD has contracts which try to assure the foundry&#x27;s economic returns, while punishing AMD&#x27;s.</p><p>All of this being factual, what we can easily say is that today AMD&#x27;s stock discounts improvements wildly in excess of the analysts&#x27; expectations. If those improvements don&#x27;t materialize -- well in excess of expectations -- the stock will have very significant downside.</p><p>Disclosure: I&#x2F;we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.</p><p>I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

So basically if you are not pressed for raw CPU, and you need just a lot of cpu for simulations, VM&#x27;s etc, xeon is your go to CPU.

Without a doubt, the Rift is the inferior system.</p><p>The Rift is more comfortable to wear, but it comes at the cost of reduced Field of View. The Vive can really be strapped onto the face hard, giving a view that almost verges on providing peripheral vision. The Rift feels like looking through binoculars in comparison.</p><p>The Touch controllers are much lighter and better balanced that the Vive wands. Personally, I found the grip gestures expected for the Touch to be very painful, but that will vary by person. I do think they are too clever by half. I got a better sense of &quot;I&#x27;m holding a gun&quot; out of gun-games on the Vive than on Touch. I also found the ability to aim at and hit targets easier on the Vive. Ultimately, I think the argument on which controller is better is missing the greater point though, as neither is an ideal design. A hand-tracking system would be much better (and no, not the Leap Motion, that thing is garbage, yes, even after the Orion update). Though Vive-centric games have always had both motion controllers and room-scale by default, whereas the Rift market is now fragmented between gamepads and Touch, and seated versus standing. Also, Touch is only just now out, whereas Vive has had developers working on content for over half a year. Indeed, Valve is already working on a new form factor for the controller.</p><p>The two camera setup for the Rift is absolutely, hands-down awful. In a room dedicated to VR setup, I constantly lost tracking when turned to the left or right. The Vive&#x27;s Lighthouse system is designed to be much, much more scalable. I&#x27;ve never had such pervasive problems maintaining tracking with the Vive.</p><p>Yes, you&#x27;re supposed to have three cameras for room-scale on the Rift. To me, that&#x27;s another point against the Rift. It&#x27;s a very complex system that is prone to failure. I can get the Vive to track a space about 20ft by 20ft on stock hardware, in default configuration, with no special finagling, just calibrate and go. I have to spend more money on an extra camera with the Rift, extra PCIe cards for all these USB3 cameras, and it&#x27;s hit or miss whether or not I can get 10ft by 10ft working.</p><p>The Rift&#x27;s camera based system is limited by how high of a resolution they can pack into the camera, how sensitive they are to tiny IR LEDs across a room, and how many spare cycles they have to run the image processing algorithm on all those camera feeds. In comparison, the Vive&#x27;s Lighthouse system is limited by how bright they can make the sync pulse, which basically amounts to an IR flash bulb.</p><p>In general, I think this is indicative of a much larger problem in VR, consumer reactions, and journalistic reporting. These are all amazing pieces of technology. If you&#x27;ve never seen any VR system after 2015, then you&#x27;re not prepared for the experience these things provide. It&#x27;s really easy to get lost in the wow-factor and fail to evaluate the system as a whole. E.g. the Rift headset is more comfortable, but is comfort an important metric compared to FOV? Is it enough that the Touch controllers are theoretically &quot;more ergonomic&quot; than the Vive wands, or is application design built around the controller important, too? Or the MS Hololens: wave-guide displays and inside out tracking are craaaaazy! But they are also kind of janky, the FOV is unusably narrow, and Windows Holographic has terrible UI affordances.</p><p>When I stop losing the forest for the trees and focus on a unified experience, the only system I have time for in my personal life right now is the Vive. We support &quot;everything&quot; in the projects we build, but if I&#x27;m just trying to relax and enjoy myself, I know the Rift and Gear VR and Hololens and Daydream are all staying on the shelf.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13174031,"story_id":13170172,"children":[{"id":13200040,"created_at_i":1481968494,"type":"comment","author":"eropple","text":"<p>FWIW, I upvoted this, but it&#x27;s also the best post I&#x27;ve ever seen on HN about the current state of VR tech.

They catered to the market available to them at the time, which was enthusiast gamers with the hardware required to run 3D video games (and to a lesser extend internet access that could play them online.) Consoles had existed for a while, but they weren&#x27;t always in the position they are now. CoD 2 was released in late 2005, the Xbox 360 was released right around the same time, and the PS3 wouldn&#x27;t come out until the next year. Internet multiplayer has been a reality on the PC since the 90&#x27;s but Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network didn&#x27;t even exist until the early 2000&#x27;s. Halo: Combat Evolved on the original Xbox famously didn&#x27;t support internet multiplayer, but its PC version did.</p><p>By this point it&#x27;s obvious that the numbers in gaming are shifting. The relatively low sticker price of a gaming console means you don&#x27;t have to work with the segment of the population who have enthusiast-grade computers. Pretty much anyone can afford to buy an Xbox 360. Crucially, the expense of console gaming isn&#x27;t frontloaded. The most expensive part of being in the PC gaming segment was (and still is) either buying a bunch of components and assembling yourself, or spending even more for a prebuilt. Assembling computer parts is actually not that hard, but <i>not</i> assembling computer parts is even easier, and you can walk out of any department store with a home console for a few hundred dollars. You&#x27;ll spend more than that over time from subscriptions, peripherals, more expensive games, etc., but you won&#x27;t have to spend a grand up front just to start playing.</p><p>Call of Duty&#x27;s publisher, Activision, observed that this new pie is titanic compared to the old one and decided to focus on grabbing a slice of it. There&#x27;s now a market available to them that&#x27;s way bigger, will pay the same amount of money for the disk, and doesn&#x27;t necessarily need things like a dedicated server with admin features. Their new approach of releasing titles on a more annual schedule for this market works because it&#x27;s substantially larger.</p><p>On the VR side of things, an HTC Vive costs <i>eight hundred dollars.</i> The Oculus Rift, which is just the headset and has no hand controllers or &quot;room scale&quot; features like the Vive, will still run you $599. Its &quot;Touch&quot; hand controllers became available only recently and buying those will send you up to the same price point as the Vive. Keep your wallet out, because VR applications require high end GPUs with as much memory as possible, like the Nvidia GTX 1060, which is likely to run you $270 or more. Today&#x27;s virtual reality options are restricted to dedicated enthusiasts with expendable income to a much greater extent than early Call of Duty games were. Aiming for a market other than &quot;VR enthusiasts&quot; is senseless, there is no other market.</p><p>There are VR products that aren&#x27;t quite so ludicrously expensive, like the Gear VR that uses a phone, but my experience is that they have very little to offer and casual consumers aren&#x27;t going to line up to buy games for them.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13175389,"story_id":13170172,"children":[]}]},{"id":13174111,"created_at_i":1481693928,"type":"comment","author":"gottam","text":"<p>Can you blame them?

(including me) people get sick. This has the downside of limiting the visibility though, which is a problem given the relatively low resolution. In a cockpit with limited view things further away look pretty bad.</p><p>But the Vive got &#x27;room scale&#x27; which is where VR really shines. Basically any game you can play within your &#x27;play area&#x27; works very good, unfortunately there are not that many.

It works well but breaks immersion a bit and gets awkward if you want to avoid enemies etc. I can highly recommend the Minecraft mod &#x27;vivecraft&#x27; in that regard.

These positionally surprising moves aren&#x27;t captured by this methodology because they don&#x27;t involve large fluctuations in valuation when the depth changes.</p><p>As to your second point, an issue with how computer chess affects the modern scene is how playing the &quot;best&quot; move in any given position isn&#x27;t representative of how humans play. Humans carry out plans and evaluate positions to the best of their ability, but the heuristics and procedure they use aren&#x27;t the same as a computer&#x27;s. For example, Karjakin didn&#x27;t prepare for his match against Carlsen last month by playing a bunch of games against Stockfish. Rather he probably analyzed Carlsen&#x27;s past games and opening choices to come up with a strategy.</p><p>I do think you can come up with a way to prepare against individually known opponents by identifying weaknesses programmatically. You can model a human&#x27;s approach to playing chess as a distribution of parameters (material, king safety, pawn structure, etc.) that take in the current position and return the best move. You also have Stockfish&#x27;s evaluation which returns the &quot;best&quot; move. With this, it&#x27;s possible that you could use build a neural network that learns to play very similarly to a certain player by using their past games as a training set and comparing the chosen move to Stockfish&#x27;s move. The network could learn to mimic the heuristics that the human individual uses to make decisions and playing against this new AI would be great practice for preparing against specific opponents.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13174096,"story_id":13172823,"children":[{"id":13174354,"created_at_i":1481699017,"type":"comment","author":"yakult","text":"<p>I&#x27;m not sure I follow your point about tactical vs positional surprise.

Yes - Housing is a problem. I think it is a salary problem. As tech corps in US earns money from the whole world, most Chinese tech corps can only attract Chinese customers. So the value generated from a same piece of code, is better in US. This makes US engineers&#x27; salary and status relatively higher in the society than those in China.</p><p>2. Yes - people are working 996. But I won&#x27;t blame the law. I&#x27;d blame the culture, or the competitive nature of Chinese tech industry. Union doesn&#x27;t do anything in China, but labour law does. It is written in favor of workers and executed properly, ask any entrepreneur in China. The problem is, I never seen anyone sued their employer. And there are a damn lot of people that actually working 996 voluntarily without asking by their boss, making the normal ones less competitive if they don&#x27;t do this.</p><p>3. No, I don&#x27;t agree here. - In tech companies of both countries, I found no difference, relationship does not matter that much even Chinese employees do have a closer personal relationship than US employees. And in other industries like finance, there are no difference either, b&#x2F;c both countries are &#x27;relation-oriented&#x27; in these industries.</p><p>4. Yes - I would not say its cruel tho. India, Korea, Singapore are all like this. Its just very competitive due to the limited educational resource and the amount of people who wants to use it. But yea I wouldn&#x27;t send my child there (If I have one).</p><p>5. Pollutions - Sad, Beijing is not a human-habitable place anymore...

At the bus station in Cork I didn&#x27;t understand a single word coming out of the clerk&#x27;s mouth. I know she was speaking English--and not Irish--but beyond that I was clueless.)</p><p>Likewise, when I&#x27;ve traveled in Asia and South America, understanding somebody with only basic English skills is relatively easy as long as they speak slowly. As long as I can identify the stream of words, I can reconstruct meaning with high fidelity. English grants huge freedoms in terms of inflection, word order, and grammar. Lurk on any linguistics forum and you quickly learn that it&#x27;s _really_ difficult to commit a bone fide, uncontestable, error in English. Most of the rules in English are basically regional preferences. I suspect that half of what is taught in ESL classes aren&#x27;t rules, per se, but merely an attempt at the formalization of the contemporary American English accent (i.e. television speech). The added structure missing from the vague rules of English aids the process of instruction. Much the same can be said for English instruction in primary and secondary school in America.</p><p>By contrast, after 15 years of hearing Cantonese on a regular basis I still can&#x27;t make heads or tails of it. I learned some Korean phrases while on the plane; I still have trouble saying Happy New Year in Cantonese.</p><p>It&#x27;s really difficult for people who have a good ear for tones (whether or not they&#x27;re musically inclined) to understand what it&#x27;s like for the rest of us. Many people don&#x27;t even realize they have a good ear for it, probably because they nonetheless had to work hard at it. But the objective research suggests that if you&#x27;re a native English speaker who picked up a tonal language, you&#x27;re not normal, no matter how hard you had to work at it.</p><p>One thing I have learned in my cross-cultural experience is that Americans, British, and to some extent Australians heavily abuse sarcasm and cultural references.[1] It&#x27;s only relatively recently that I&#x27;ve realized how sarcastic I can be (which is less sarcastic than many Americans), and how much confusion and miscommunication it has caused with foreign borne co-workers, friends, and family. And maybe part of the reason Americans rely on sarcasm and cultural references so much is because it&#x27;s difficult to reliably encode signals in English speech. Emphasizing certain syllables, for instance, often only works regionally. The manner in which a New Yorker draws out a vowel to signal emotional content might actually be the normal mode of articulation in the Deep South. And so almost all Americans, even ones who don&#x27;t abuse sarcasm, have become adept at recognizing secondary meaning based purely on the word content of speech, not the manner in which it is spoken.</p><p>[1] I suspect Germany and maybe even France might be similar in that regard.

I have two big memories from this time that stuck with me. The first is the time a dev on Civilization 1 visited our class. He spoke about the &quot;AI&quot; of civilization, which he revealed to be a simple random number generator. He told us people often thought it was far more complex, but that&#x27;s really all there was to it.</p><p>The second memory is when we actually built a 3d engine + game from scratch. Every week we had to add a new feature, so one week I obviously took on the AI. My partner and I were doing a soccer-style game, and I had grand visions of implementing a sophisticated AI using what I&#x27;d been learning in my other classes, like SVMs and neural networks. I started doing research, and was shocked to learn that no video games at the time did any of this. I learned that computers at the time weren&#x27;t really capable of running several versions of an ML algorithm simultaneously (one per agent) while dealing with everything else - and more importantly that there was little need. I ended up spending a couple days building out a basic state machine, and it worked. Even the professor thought we added incredible intelligence to the players, who in reality were just following ~10 rules like &quot;if player in defense mode: move towards the midpoint between the ball and the goal while keeping some distance between other players&quot;.</p><p>My main take-away from that class is that there was little need for actual AI in video games, and that I should pursue a different career path :&#x2F;</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13174542,"story_id":13174542,"children":[{"id":13178125,"created_at_i":1481738561,"type":"comment","author":"bluetwo","text":"<p>I&#x27;ve always found the tension between ivory tower AI and real application in games fascinating.</p><p>To me, games seem like a great place to test theory in a mode that can be unsupervised and self-grading, while also representing real world contraints.</p><p>I&#x27;m glad to see DeepMind and others make some advances.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13175796,"story_id":13174542,"children":[]},{"id":13177371,"created_at_i":1481734056,"type":"comment","author":"TPCrow","text":"<p>I had the same outlook, however it is for a game I am currently in development.</p><p>And for those who are reading this, and are interested in game AI with interest in making true machine learning integrated into their characters, I gope this will help keep you inspired.</p><p>So, like you, I had grandeous ideas and vision about adaptive, machine learning approach to controlling my character in a platform-based fighting game.

I was also surprised at what &quot;AI&quot; looked like when I entered the game industry. It&#x27;s easy to dismiss what game devs do as not &quot;actual&quot; AI, when really it&#x27;s just two definitions of the terms.</p><p>In the academic community today, &quot;AI&quot; implies <i>learning</i>, often unassisted. That&#x27;s a fine definition, but it&#x27;s also a recent one.</p><p>When &quot;AI&quot; was originally coined, it simply referred to software that did things people used to think required some intelligence. Stuff like OCR and playing chess.</p><p>As our expectations of what computers can do grew, we kept redefining &quot;intelligence&quot; to mean fewer and fewer things. There&#x27;s a weird feedback loop here, because our informal definition of &quot;intelligence&quot; is often &quot;whatever only people can do&quot;. As soon as computers could beat us at chess, &quot;beating a human at chess&quot; got kicked out of the &quot;intelligence&quot; set. That meant chess software no longer gets called AI.</p><p>In games, &quot;AI&quot; just means &quot;the code that controls what likelife in-game entities do&quot;. In the fiction of the game world, these entities have real intelligence. The game&#x27;s implementation of that an artificial simulation of that intelligence. Thus -- &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;.</p><p>In practice, it often lines up with the historical definition of what kinds of code was called &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;. Many early AI researchers were in fact using games as their testbed.</p><p>It also ends up being fairly simple. Humans are so eager to anthropomorphize that it doesn&#x27;t take <i>that</i> much simulated intelligence to get us to see a simulated entity as acting &quot;alive&quot;. Simpler AI is also easier to implement, easier to debug, faster to execute, and <i>much</i> simpler to tune.</p><p>Learning algorithms are rare in games because they more often than not implement an anti-goal. A game designer&#x27;s job is to give the player a carefully balanced experience that rides the knife edge between too easy (boring) and too hard (frustrating).</p><p>It is <i>not</i> the game&#x27;s goal to make the entities as smart as possible. They would just kick the player&#x27;s ass and that&#x27;s no fun.</p><p>An AI that learned on its own is very hard to tune and would likely make the game no fun.</p><p>I <i>do</i> think there&#x27;s room in games for learning AIs. But what I think would make sense is:</p><p>1. The fitness function the AI should train for is <i>fun</i>, not <i>beating the player</i>. Instead of rewarding AIs that win, reward ones that the player says were fun to play against.</p><p>2.

You can&#x27;t just install it and have it work for you out of the box. Another poster suggested that there would be people for whom Emacs and vi &#x27;just click&#x27;, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s how anyone learns to use emacs. You <i>need</i> to customize the editor in order to make it useful. It&#x27;s not about memorizing key combinations (that&#x27;ll come with use over a long period of time), it&#x27;s about employing the ridiculously powerful tools that come with Emacs or can be downloaded from the package repositories. With Emacs, you can do <i>anything you want</i>. When I first started using Emacs, it felt like I was laying siege to a fortress. Doing basic things like saving a file involved looking up a key combination. Now anything else feels not much better than notepad.</p><p>To learn emacs, I think that the best place to start (after giving up on the tutorial) is to read other people&#x27;s init.el files. You can find these all over github. You should read through them and any customization or function that you think you&#x27;d like to have for yourself, copy (the key combination for paste is C-y FYI) that into your init.el file (~&#x2F;.emacs by default). As you read through the init files, you&#x27;ll find out more and more about what Emacs can do for you, and you&#x27;ll build an editor that&#x27;s comfortable for you. IMO, without a custom init file, Emacs isn&#x27;t really Emacs. Treat it like a side project for the first month or so, and I believe that eventually you&#x27;ll move over completely.

It was so slow that I noticed that I was debugging 80% of the time and writing code about 5 to 10, and thinking about code 10 to 15.

I never felt slow or inefficient until I saw a screencast about Apache config that used vim and I was amazed to see how the person could simply jump to places he wanted. So I set out to try vim. I switched it for all my hobby work but it didn&#x27;t catch on. So I went back to Visual Studio and in 2014 I thought I should give it another go. This time I started by installing the VsVim extension for Visual Studio.</p><p>This is how I got good with Vim:\n- In the beginning (I think 2 weeks) I only focused on using the motions (word, next character, paragraph, blocks and regex motion), common commands like d, c and R.\nIf it helps I saw a screencast (one of the Vim London meetup videos) which broke down Vim into a grammar to be thought of as &quot;operator + count + motion&quot;.\nI also slowed the key repeat rate to make sure I don&#x27;t hold arrow keys to move. DISABLE ARROW KEYS IN VSVIMRC.</p><p>- After around 2 weeks I got comfortable with that and switched to pure Vim whenever I could. You can set up an external program to call up on the current file in Visual Studio. I also learned to touch type in the next 2 weeks so that I could reap more benefits.</p><p>- After a week of moving to Vim, I started writing my vimrc with things like colorcolumn, autoindent and other simple stuff. I also installed relevant text object plugins [1]. I installed some language specific plugins and started reading the :help pages. :helpgrep is very handy. At this time I think I felt I was back to my old productivity level if not above it. It took around 3 weeks I think.</p><p>- I then proceeded to learn about jumplist, named registers, location list, differences between buffers, windows, splits and tabs and how they are INTENDED to be used. It took me around one week.</p><p>- At that point I simply started looking at some Vim screencasts [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8] and [9].</p><p>CONCLUSION:</p><p>I am more productive in Vim when writing anything other than C#, F# or Java. Visual Studio excels in that department.\nI debug NodeJS in VSCode.\nFor all other things I use Vim and am noticeably faster now compared to other editors.\nAlthough yes, I really miss Visual Studio a lot when using Vim. But thankfully Visual Studio has the great VsVim plugin.</p><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kana&#x2F;vim-textobj-user&#x2F;wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kana&#x2F;vim-textobj-user&#x2F;wiki</a></p><p>[2]: My .vimrc <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hashhar&#x2F;dotfiles&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;neovim&#x2F;.config&#x2F;nvim&#x2F;init.vim\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hashhar&#x2F;dotfiles&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;neovim&#x2F;.conf...</a></p><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;vimlondon&#x2F;videos\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;vimlondon&#x2F;videos</a></p><p>[4]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xZTkrB_tEoY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xZTkrB_tEoY</a></p><p>[5]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;ThoughtbotVideo&#x2F;search?query=vim\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;ThoughtbotVideo&#x2F;search?query=vi...</a></p><p>[6]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;derekwyatt.org&#x2F;vim&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;derekwyatt.org&#x2F;vim&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;index.html</a></p><p>[7]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimcasts.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimcasts.org&#x2F;</a></p><p>[8]: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tilvim.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tilvim.com&#x2F;</a></p><p>[9]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sanctum.geek.nz&#x2F;arabesque&#x2F;vim-anti-patterns&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sanctum.geek.nz&#x2F;arabesque&#x2F;vim-anti-patterns&#x2F;</a></p>","points":null,"parent_id":13166670,"story_id":13165919,"children":[]},{"id":13169147,"created_at_i":1481653474,"type":"comment","author":"lunchboxsushi","text":"<p>I&#x27;ve found that for Node.JS &#x2F; Golang &#x2F; PHP &#x2F; JavaScript it has been well worth it, my workflow feels faster, I have less time spent missing clicking around even copying a line or changing text inside quotes or braces.
