The existence of a maximum local speed -- whatever it is, it could be much faster than light -- sets the slope of a nonempty open convex cone of tangent vectors (a causal cone at each point for the field-values at that point) which in turn lets us fix a first order quasilinear system of PDEs admitting a hyperbolization, and in that you can always find an observer that sees an event horizon.</p><p>The formation of the BH creates a dynamical spacetime with an acceleration between observers before and after the collapse, and that alone is sufficient to produce an event horizon.</p><p>Abolishing &#x27;c&#x27; (as a general free parameter defined at every point; the definition can even vary by location in spacetime) seems a lot harder to swallow than abolishing event horizons.

Correctness and completeness of any theory in mathematical physics are esentially orthogonal.   You can have a complete theory that is just wrong, for example.</p><p>As I wrote a bit earlier in this thread, the most straightforward approach to quantizing General Relativity fails in strong gravity.  Additionally, the classical field theory that is General Relativity is defined on a smooth manifold and yet so far we have been unable to escape the conclusion that some systems of mass-energy inevitably produce a non-smooth discontinuity.  A completion of classical General Relativity requires the smoothing of these regions.  Sharpening this, the problem with GR is the prediction of a gravitational singularity; if singularities are physical at all (even if they are in a region of spacetime that is inaccessible outside event horizons), then General Relativity is incomplete in its own terms.</p><p>The Standard Model as a paradigm of quantum field theory, on the other hand, is defined against a flat spacetime and thus relies on the result from General Relativity that the flat spacetime metric is induced on the tangent space of every point in a smooth spacetime.    So if GR is incomplete, so is the Standard Model, in its own terms.   (This is not just an academic point; any theory of gravity that does not reproduce the Poincaré invariance of flat spacetime in the energy scales of the Standard Model has a terrible <i>correctness</i> problem.)  Additionally, the Standard Model is not especially well-defined at GUT energy scales.   Additionally, the Standard Model does not describe the whole of the non-gravitational content of the universe; for example, it is silent on dark matter.</p><p>The Standard Model is highly correct, however, in the limits where it is effectively complete.  It&#x27;s a pity it has so many free parameters that have to be determined by experiment.</p><p>Likewise, General Relativity is both highly correct in the limits of present observability, and it is complete in its own terms <i>if</i> one admits the possibility that gravitational singularities only arise in our idealized models and that, for example, there are no exactly Schwarzschild black holes anywhere in the past, present or future of our universe.   (One have to show that, and also that there are no other physically realizable systems of matter that can generate non-smoothness in our spacetime.  That&#x27;s not an easy ask.  Although General Relativity has only one of the free paramaters complained about in the previous paragraph, it doesn&#x27;t offer much guidance about how to show that you can&#x27;t actually generate a low-Q Kerr-Newman metric in reality, and worse, some of that guidance must come from the high-energy behaviour of matter fields -- we can only be as complete as the Standard Model right now.)</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13145459,"story_id":13145216,"children":[{"id":13158754,"created_at_i":1481557008,"type":"comment","author":"lambdadmitry","text":"<p>Posts like this is why I read HN.

This is only a problem in strong gravity -- where in this context, &quot;strong&quot; means more than one loop of gravitons on a Feynman diagram.   With multi-loop Feynman diagrams involving other massless propagators we can use a number of techniques to reduce the integrals; these techniques do not work with (massless) gravitons.</p><p>One could describe this form of renormalization as a enabling a reduction of infinite modes by making a finite set of measurements at high energy to fix a parameter; this works well for light, for example.   Einstein gravity, on the other hand, is <i>perturbatively</i> non-renormalizable, at least using the same techniques, because you need to make an ever increasing set of these types of parameter-fixing measurements at higher energies, and ultimately in strong gravity (as defined above) you need an infinite number of them.</p><p>Since there is an overwhelming amount of evidence for Einstein gravity everywhere we have been able to look so far, this poses a problem: how do you quantize gravity in a way that makes useful predictions about systems in strong gravity?  There are lots of research programmes looking at this problem.</p><p>(The opposite side of the coin is that programmes to geometrize the fields of the Standard Model exist, but they run into difficulty too.   Taken together, this is the underlying situation supporting the claim that QM and GR disagree about QM scale physics where local curvature distorts lengths and times at the scale of SM scatterings.)</p><p>Outside of strong gravity, however, perturbatively quantized gravity on the one hand, and semiclassical gravity on the other, are perfectly fine effective field theories (effective field theories in the Kenneth G Wilson sense; General Relativity as an effective field theory in this sense I&#x27;ll call &quot;the EFT&quot; below).</p><p>One of the features of black holes generically is that strong curvature is found only very near the (unremovable by change of coordinates in General Relativity, gravitational) singularity.   The event horizon or horizons, depending on metric the black hole sources, are found further from the singularity as the black hole&#x27;s mass increases.    Around an arbitrarily high mass black hole, one will find the horizon is in a region of arbitrarily flat spacetime.   If the compact massive objects we observe to date are astrophysical black holes, they do not have strong gravity at the horizon.</p><p>This is one of the critical parts of the AMPS firewalls &quot;paradox&quot;, wherein one of the set of properties of a black hole which cannot all be true is the no-drama conjecture: an infaller at a sufficiently massive black hole will experience no tidal stresses.</p><p>Afshordi, one of the authors of the paper that&#x27;s the topic of the article has been doing productive phenomenology in his various collaborations, and his argument that there are classes of quantum gravity theory that can be excluded if the observations do not disappear under analysis (e.g., they&#x27;re not systematic errors, and aren&#x27;t &quot;lucky&quot; low-sigma correlations).</p><p>It&#x27;s more than a bit provocative to suggest that the observations suggest that the EFT fails outside the horizon (one of the possibilities that has been discussed by Polchinski and others in the wake of AMPS (he&#x27;s the &quot;P&quot;)), which is fine, since the point will stand or fall on the basis of evidence rather than the consequences for various QG research programmes. :-)</p><p>For now it&#x27;s pretty safe to work on the assumption that the EFT is fine <i>at least</i> everywhere outside the event horizon and the extremely hot dense early universe, and that a UV completion to GR will be completely compatible with the EFT outside strong gravity and inside a region at least a little bigger than the observable universe.</p><p>Finally, all this means that although I won&#x27;t exactly endorse your wording in your third last sentence, I do certainly agree with the sentiment.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13145316,"story_id":13145216,"children":[{"id":13146507,"created_at_i":1481388904,"type":"comment","author":"AlexCoventry","text":"<p>Any reading suggestions for someone who wants to understand this and has a very strong math background but no physics background beyond basic second-year QM?</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13145797,"story_id":13145216,"children":[{"id":13146888,"created_at_i":1481392985,"type":"comment","author":"raattgift","text":"<p>It&#x27;s hard to gauge (pardon the pun) where to start you based on that.</p><p>I&#x27;ll guess that you&#x27;re keen on understanding the General Relativity part in detail.</p><p>Carroll and ‘t Hooft have kindly put up lecture notes that might be a good starting place.

While muscle can grow quickly, tendons and ligaments take much longer to handle the new workload.</p><p>Two, form makes <i>all</i> the difference -- running can either feel heavy and difficult, or lightweight and joyous. But unfortunately, it can take a <i>lot</i> of learning and effort to get to the latter -- good relaxed form is not easy to learn, landing the right way on your foot is incredibly important, for some people things like Vibram shoes help, you might have severe muscle tension preventing good form (see a massage therapist, get a Theracane and use it religiously, etc.), you might have horribly tight hamstrings and need specific stretches for those, the list goes on and on. Me personally, I also had to lose a bunch of weight (getting down to my ideal BMI) for running to feel light and easy rather than painful and pounding.</p><p>And third, being in the right mood for enjoying running makes a huge difference too. When I&#x27;m not in the mood for it, but I run anyways (because I&#x27;m feeling guilty about not running, etc.), I generally stay miserable. But sometimes I really <i>am</i> in the mood for it -- I got enough sleep the night before, I ate a couple hours ago so I have energy, but not so long ago I&#x27;m hungry, it&#x27;s not too early in the day (I&#x27;m not a morning person), but not too late either that I&#x27;m tired -- finding the right time is <i>huge</i>, and makes all the difference.</p><p>Honestly, I love running, but it took a <i>lot</i> of time and effort to figure out everything above that made it work for me -- in my case, years. (And pretty much everything about the programmer lifestyle works against you.) But when you manage to make everything align, it feels <i>great</i>, like you&#x27;re tapping some kind of primal happiness where you&#x27;re back on the African savannah tracking down antelope...

When one party wanted to tell something to the other it made a fire-sign. When the other answered, both of them opened the hole at the same time. And with the help of another fire-sign closed it again at the same time, too. In the end the water covered the stick until the point of the wanted message.&quot;</p><p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mlahanas.de&#x2F;Greeks&#x2F;Communication.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mlahanas.de&#x2F;Greeks&#x2F;Communication.htm</a></p><p>[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mlahanas.de&#x2F;Greeks&#x2F;Technology&#x2F;AncientGreekTechnology028.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mlahanas.de&#x2F;Greeks&#x2F;Technology&#x2F;AncientGreekTechnol...</a></p>","points":null,"parent_id":13149312,"story_id":13146315,"children":[{"id":13154386,"created_at_i":1481501176,"type":"comment","author":"pavel_lishin","text":"<p>That&#x27;s incredibly clever.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13149474,"story_id":13146315,"children":[]},{"id":13154420,"created_at_i":1481501531,"type":"comment","author":"kakarot","text":"<p>That is AWESOME.

Many if not most people have settled on the theory of escape from a painful existence as an explanation, including many alcoholics. I&#x27;ve been battling alcohol since I was a teenager and now I&#x27;m almost 60. I&#x27;ve been in and out of rehab, lots of therapy and psychiatry, lots of sober time, a family with grown kids, a successful career and yet my most recent relapse almost killed me. More on that at the end.</p><p>Alcoholism is beyond thought and emotion. It operates at another level. It takes Kings and Queens. It takes happy family men, while often skipping abused children who grow up to be unhappy adults that can&#x27;t hold a family together. It takes spiritual and religious leaders such as Alan Watts. The list of great, productive and seemingly happy people who are destroyed by alcohol is a long one.\nMy theory is that is a genetic glitch that allows alcohol to get hooked into the autonomic nervous system. It&#x27;s telling in &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; a woman tells Cage&#x27;s character to quit drinking and he replies &quot;why don&#x27;t you tell me to stop breathing?&quot; Carl Sagan liked to talk about our reptilian brain. That&#x27;s the way I look at it. When the lizard brain wants a drink, it&#x27;s going to get a drink. Luckily for me, it&#x27;s not all the time. The urge comes and goes (sometimes for years.) The gene seems to run in families. If it is cured, my bet it will be through genetic therapy.</p><p>I&#x27;m not saying that resolving emotional issues doesn&#x27;t make it easier to stay sober. Many things make it easier to stay sober. Sometimes I just go somewhere where I can&#x27;t get it. That helps. It&#x27;s why a lot of guys stay in the Navy. They have productive sober time at sea. Finding other activities and diversions certainly help. I like to program. I&#x27;ve often stayed sober by programming.</p><p>My last relapse almost killed me because I&#x27;m finding as I have become older, my ability to fight it is greatly weakened. On top of that, I go into a trance-like state where I stay I will stay drunk for days and weeks at a time unless someone who knows me intervenes. That is terrible on the body and as the body weakens, the ability to resist weakens.

I think it&#x27;s useful article, both as a pedagogical &quot;proof of concept&quot; and as a way of evaluating the ability of current compilers to vectorize code.   I used a shell script to compile your code with a variety of compilers (gcc-4.8, gcc-4.9, gcc-5, gcc-6, icc-16, icc-17, and clang-4.0) each with a variety of compilation options (-O0, -O1, -O2, -O3, -Ofast, -march=native, -flto&#x2F;-ipo) to see how they fared on a recent Intel Skylake machine.  Across all combinations, I got results that mostly matched what you found.</p><p>Some takeaways (highly influenced by my own opinions):</p><p>Avoid -O0 for production code.  It no longer means &quot;without optimization&quot;, and should be understood as &quot;put everything on the stack for easy debugging&quot;.</p><p>The difference between -O1, -O2, -O3, and -Ofast can be large, but in this case the spread was small (about 10%).  Higher numbers usually mean faster performance, but not always.  If it really matters, measure.  If you have to guess, use -Ofast (which for GCC is approximately -O3 plus -ffast-math).</p><p>The flag that makes the biggest positive difference here is &quot;-march=native&quot;, which tells the compiler it can use all the instructions supported by the machine you are compiling on. If you are running the software yourself rather than distributing it to others, this should probably be your default.  If you don&#x27;t specify it (or another architecture baseline) your code will run on much older machines, but at the cost of missing many of the vectorization improvements made over the last decade.</p><p>Link time optimization (-flto for gcc and clang) or interprocedural optimization (-ipo in icc) lets the compiler optimize across compilation units rather than only within them.  Approximately, it makes everything a candidate for inlining, thus giving many more opportunities for optimization.  It doesn&#x27;t make a big difference here (since almost all the work is done in one function) but you should likely be using it more than you are.</p><p>Overall, the &quot;portable&quot; version is slower than the &quot;model&quot;, which in turn is slower than the &quot;assembly&quot;.  One read of this is that we don&#x27;t yet have a &quot;sufficiently clever compiler&quot;:  the &quot;naive&quot; C version is slower than the &quot;explicitly vectorizable&quot; one, and both are beaten by &quot;naive assembly&quot;.  This is definitely interesting, and often true, and counters the refrain of &quot;don&#x27;t bother trying to beat the compiler&quot;, but I think it&#x27;s worth digging deeper and asking why the simplistic assembly is faster than the complicated compiler.</p><p>I think the main reason here is that the C code is not sufficiently precise, and doesn&#x27;t actually reflect the programmer&#x27;s intent.  The compiler fails to vectorize because the code as written isn&#x27;t safe to vectorize: legally, there could be &quot;aliasing&quot; between the different arrays.  The assembly is written to take advantage of the absence of aliasing, but the compiler wasn&#x27;t given enough information to do this.</p><p>Some of this information can be provided by a liberal sprinkling of &quot;restrict&quot; keywords: &quot;void fft_transform(const void * tables, double * restrict real, double * restrict imag)&quot;.  But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to put the blame on the programmer for skipping these.  Rather than being safe and assuming that the arrays for &quot;real&quot; and &quot;imag&quot; might overlap, in this case it would clearly be more helpful for the compiler to ask the programmer for more guidance rather than silently giving up.</p><p>Intel&#x27;s been doing a fairly good job of giving icc (and icpc) the ability to explain why loops cannot be vectorized.  &quot;-qopt-report&quot; and &quot;-guide-vec&quot; give useful hints about what to be changed to allow vectorization.   But it still requires significant expertise to figure out what the hints mean, which pragmas to add, and whether it&#x27;s safe to add them.</p><p>In this case, the hand written assembly is faster not because the compiler is generating bad code, but because it incorporates the programmer&#x27;s silent assumptions.  It would be nice if compilers were able to give better feedback to the programmer, as a means of making these assumptions (or their absence) more explicit.  Do gcc and clang have options to provide this guidance?  Are there outside tools that can?</p><p>compilation script: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;nkurz&#x2F;ff4f6a495428c5c0eaffb3521ad8439b\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;nkurz&#x2F;ff4f6a495428c5c0eaffb3521ad843...</a></p><p>portable results: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;nkurz&#x2F;a44d57538d4530362951beb1ea2c4cad\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;nkurz&#x2F;a44d57538d4530362951beb1ea2c4c...</a></p><p>model results: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;nkurz&#x2F;2f362185b7fd42889b8bb533ced5f7d5\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;nkurz&#x2F;2f362185b7fd42889b8bb533ced5f7...</a></p><p>assembly results: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;nkurz&#x2F;6e797e8b635931d2a0e4f32af6a12d1a\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;nkurz&#x2F;6e797e8b635931d2a0e4f32af6a12d...</a></p>","points":null,"parent_id":13149955,"story_id":13147890,"children":[{"id":13152077,"created_at_i":1481477912,"type":"comment","author":"p1esk","text":"<p>Thanks!

Specifically, I transposed the second matrix so both matrices have the same second dimension, and therefore I could do row&#x2F;row dot product instead of row&#x2F;column dot product. This change in itself gained me about 15% improvement, I&#x27;m guessing because it&#x27;s more cache friendly. But I mainly did this so I can use AVX mul_ps intrinsic for the dot product. Then, to sum up the resulting array, I used horizontal add intrinsic in a recursive manner. I compiled this code with -mavx2 flag for my Broadwell Xeon CPU. \nThe code is here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;michaelklachko&#x2F;NN&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;avx_dot_standalone.c\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;michaelklachko&#x2F;NN&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;avx_dot_sta...</a></p><p>Unfortunately, the code actually got slightly slower!

Looks reasonable, although your recursive approach to horizontal summation probably isn&#x27;t what you want.  Rather than writing and re-reading you probably want to &quot;accumulate&quot; the sums into two YMM registers, then add these, then horizontal sum once.  Not all instructions have the same cost, and horizontal addition is more costly than addition or multiplication.</p><p>Look at Agner&#x27;s instruction tables for Broadwell for details: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;agner.org&#x2F;optimize&#x2F;instruction_tables.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;agner.org&#x2F;optimize&#x2F;instruction_tables.pdf</a>.  It&#x27;s initially hard to figure out what the columns mean, but worth the effort.  Going further, you can probably use the &quot;FMA&quot; (Fused Multiply Add) instructions, which are essentially designed for dot products.  You can do two of these per cycle,  each of which does a multiplication and addition of a YMM vector.</p><p><i>I compiled this code with -mavx2 flag for my Broadwell Xeon CPU.</i></p><p>I can&#x27;t remember the details of -march for Clang, but I recall that there is some oddity with older versions that -march=native on Broadwell requires -mavx2 in addition.  But to get the correct instruction set, I think it needs both flags.  In most cases (always for icc and gcc), -march=native is all you need.</p><p><i>when compiling with these flags, does clang actually use those AVX instructions that I tried to do manually</i></p><p>Yes, exactly that.  Modern optimizing compilers look at the code you&#x27;ve written, and (when asked politely and all the stars aline) rewrite it to do something equivalent using the vector instructions.   In many cases, you can get the same performance with simple scalar code as with vector intrinsics if the compiler cooperates, but it can be tricky to write the scalar code in a manner that the compiler is willing to vectorize.</p><p>It&#x27;s easy and worthwhile to look at the assembly generated by the compiler.  It&#x27;s difficult to understand at first, but it&#x27;s a great way to learn, and you should be doing it for any loop where the performance really matters.  Figure out &quot;objdump -d&quot; use &quot;perf record &#x2F; perf report&quot;, or compile to assembly with -S.  Take a look at the fast compiler generated code to see what it&#x27;s doing, then figure out if you can make it faster.</p><p><i>I&#x27;m also not clear what&#x27;s the difference between aligned and unaligned AVX load&#x2F;store instructions, in terms of performance.</i></p><p>A deep morass, but worth looking into.  Agner covers it pretty well.  On current x64, there is essentially no difference in speed between the aligned and unaligned instructions when using aligned data.  The aligned instructions crash when they encounter unaligned data, and the unaligned instructions continue but might be slowed down.</p><p>My general rule for modern Intel processors would be to try very hard to align your data if you can, but always use the unaligned instructions if they exist. Unaligned stores are typically much worse than unaligned reads.  But apart from unaligned stores that cross 4KB boundaries, vector instructions are usually still a win if your algorithm allows them.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13163799,"story_id":13147890,"children":[{"id":13190134,"created_at_i":1481849113,"type":"comment","author":"p1esk","text":"<p>Nate, first of all, thank you for your detailed responses.

If you want reasonable speed for some of these domains in C, you have to basically force the compiler to do it, by manually forcing these &quot;assembler optimizations&quot; anyway.

In this realm, efficiency matters a hell-of-a-lot.</p><p>Having implemented things like ChaCha20 before in C -- it&#x27;s very hard to get the C compiler to get anywhere close, by itself, to what a hand-optimized implementation can do. Just look at Ted Krovetz ChaCha20 written in C: it&#x27;s fast, in the 1-cycle-per-byte range (my own implementation being in the ~5cpb range), but the code is absolutely ridiculous, because it has to &quot;work with&quot; the C compiler so much and hold its hand, it has to manually use SIMD intrinsics (which still rely on you knowing about the underlying architecture anyway), manually unroll loops etc, careful exit fast paths, etc. By comparison, doing things like vectorized, multi-byte loads or carefully controlled unrolling is relatively &quot;simple&quot; in native assembly and does not require working against any optimizer.

It&#x27;s not clear to me, honestly, if it wouldn&#x27;t be better to just write the core loop in assembly and call that. It may very well be <i>less complex</i> by some standards. Also, just to head off this suggestion: no, simply converting my naive code to use GCC vectorized types (not SIMD intrinsics, but vector types) didn&#x27;t make up for this difference at all, despite the fact it&#x27;s a fairly perfect case for vectorized code. It made maybe a 10% difference at the end. I need a 500% difference to be in the same ballpark. I&#x27;m not going to get it by crossing my fingers, unfortunately.</p><p>That said, Ted&#x27;s implementation has redeeming qualities, including the fact it can be portable, and it does remove some complexity by e.g. not having to register allocate manually. The compiler can take care of instruction scheduling, too. But it only achieves its speed at the cost of a lot of incidental complexity when dealing with the compiler. A lot of the things it&#x27;s doing are things you have to carefully consider in an assembly optimization, too. You&#x27;re not gaining anything by &quot;Using C because I can express anything&quot;, the main thing you&#x27;re gaining is a slight ease-of-development, because some of the code is portable. You still have to do all the actual hard work yourself.</p><p>At that point, when you&#x27;re doing that much work -- for a lot of cases, you might as well just say &quot;Screw the compiler&quot; and write it manually, and also yield even more gains, such as a library like this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;floodyberry&#x2F;chacha-opt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;floodyberry&#x2F;chacha-opt</a> -- the efficiency gains may absolutely trump development time, when you realize these efficiency gains compound on each other (2x work for 5% benefit is a lot more reasonable when you realize that 5% benefit is going to be realized 100, 10,000, or even 10,000,000 times over, consistently, with every single use).</p><p>And in any case, if we want to be pedantic, your assertion is just factually 100% wrong anyway. Here&#x27;s an example: IEEE-compliant floating point division can easily expressed in assembly, on IEEE-compliant platforms. IEEE-compliant floating point division is, in a real sense, <i>impossible to implement in C&#x2F;C++ by the rules of the language standard</i>. Why? Because division by zero is defined in IEEE and not C&#x2F;C++, even if &#x27;float&#x27; and &#x27;double&#x27; in your system are IEEE-compliant. Another example is overshifting a register, which is undefined in C&#x2F;C++ and perfectly defined for several architectures. There are absolutely cases where you can write completely legitimate assembly that is impossible to write in standards-compliant C, if you want to be language-lawyer-y about it.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13148213,"story_id":13147890,"children":[]},{"id":13149029,"created_at_i":1481419272,"type":"comment","author":"user5994461","text":"<p>Wow.

A voice is made up of many different frequencies at various strength levels.  Most frequencies of a voice have nearly 0 energy.  Some have more energy, with varying levels of strength.  DFT breaks the voice down and figures out the strength levels for all the frequencies.  The frequency range in human voice is from about 70Hz to 10KHz.  That&#x27;s why you see some strength at 300Hz, 600Hz, and 900Hz.

Each element represents a frequency fraction with respect to the input size.  So F[0] is at 1&#x2F;1000 fraction, F[1] at 2&#x2F;1000 fraction, etc, upto F[499] at 500&#x2F;1000 fraction.

That worked through a series of behaviors that were built in that could be overridden by external input.</p><p>Consider the case of a &#x27;leg&#x27;. A robot needs to lift its legs and move them forward in order to achieve forward locomotion. This means it needs a gait where it steps while keeping itself balanced. Brooks created a system where the highest ranked function that could run, would. So if the robot was stable, it unlocked the &#x27;lift function&#x27; and if the leg was lifted it unlocked the higher priority forward function, and if the leg was forward it unlocked the higher priority balance function. I really liked it a lot and have used it in other embedded systems since then.</p><p>As a result I see the &quot;smart&quot; house system similarly, which is that I would build systems that were self contained, and could see input from outside.

I wired for alarm, but didn&#x27;t bother to hook it up right away.</p><p>What is working now? The alarm is connected to a raspberry pi so I can hook into it. Now it arms&#x2F;disarms at a set time each day so I don&#x27;t have to remember to do it.

Most are on a cron job to do what I want, but a web UI lets you take control.</p><p>Wi-fi thermostat with an API - no 3rd part website needed. Why can&#x27;t they all be this way? I can turn the system off when I&#x27;m out of town and fire it up before I get home. I also wrote some stuff to log usage each day along with the weather. Adding the alarm system status with the HVAC status and it will text me if the A&#x2F;C is running and a window is open.</p><p>Garage door, custom GPIO hack to the opener.

I can open&#x2F;close it from a web page, but that is rarely used.</p><p>Alexa skill - this is the latest piece and the only one that needs Internet to keep working (except sending email, of course). It ties into all the other pieces and gives voice control to the parts that make sense for me. I won&#x27;t let it disarm the alarm, I just don&#x27;t trust a 3rd party to do that.</p><p>I pieced this together so I could learn and have something to play with, but now it is just nice.

The world really needs another social &quot;service&quot; or task list manager.</p><p>If you want to learn programming and how the machine works you start with C. The best part is that C is a small language and you only need a single book to get started. Once you&#x27;ve got the hang of basic principles, you write little toy programs, web server, proxy server, parsers, etc. When you learn C you also focus on what&#x27;s important, which is solving the problem, and creating instructions that align with how the CPU works, and you avoid all these traps of wasting time learning how to scaffold abstraction (like OOP) instead of writing code that actually does something.</p><p>During this early period in your learning you should be focused on this, and not read arbitrary blog posts or watch arbitrary talks on what&#x27;s the &quot;best&quot; programming practices... You should not be frequenting Stack Overflow to pick up bad habits from seemingly correct answers to the wrong questions. Remember, you don&#x27;t know shit, who are you to judge what&#x27;s right or not in an accepted answer? You will be brainwashed by all this crap out there.</p><p>Now, depending on why you want to learn programming, you can start heading in that direction. The way to really learn, is bite off more than you can chew, but it has to be a project you really care about. You will learn as you go. I advice you not waste too much time, especially on &quot;tutorial videos&quot;, just copying code someone else wrote will teach you a lot less than figuring out the correct code to write on your own. It&#x27;s incredible how helpless people learning today have become compared to how things were figured out in the old days. When people actually learned how to write an interpreter or something like that just out of reverse engineering another. So, don&#x27;t sell yourself short.</p><p>You have to think about this kind of like how most people get confused when it comes to all these contradicting articles and research on health issues and what you should or shouldn&#x27;t eat, the best exercises for this or that.

While it&#x27;s certainly possible to learn programming on one&#x27;s own, that approach is fraught with the same problems that learning advanced maths, physics or martial arts on one&#x27;s own would be: you&#x27;re apt to  miss (or never even encounter) foundational ideas and techniques, develop idiosyncratic or even inappropriate approaches, be unfamiliar with key theory, etc.  My experience with several generations of programmers is that the self-taught can be excellent programmers, but they also tend to not play well with others, have difficulty integrating their code into larger projects, and sometimes wander off into territory (and algorithms) a more formally trained person would know to avoid.  They also have a lamentable tendency to reinvent the wheel, and to be unable to effectively argue for or against a particular approach on the basis of objective criteria.

The most important thing to start is actually to try to find a way to dull out the noise and actually learn solid principles. Someone trying to get into web development today can quickly spend a week trying to set up Babel and PostCSS and get tremendously discouraged before they realize they are actually going about it the wrong way.</p><p>My suggestion to people who are new to coding is to actually go into a domain where that ISNT going to happen. If you have the motivation&#x2F;time, don&#x27;t try to learn to program by learning web dev. Instead, pick something like &quot;Think Python&quot; or some other resource that you can use as the CANONICAL resource for truth, and that will give you a linear path to progress to.

Find that ONE canonical resource that can move you to the next step, and proceed with it as your bible until you have enough under your belt that you can then go out and explore concepts -- which you now can hang onto the solid foundation you built. For web, for instance, Steve Huffman&#x27;s course at Udacity is pretty excellent at giving you the barebones of how a web application works. Do that. Forget styling, forget responsiveness, forget everything... but use that as your one-stop-shop to understand how a website works. Ok, now do your own. Ok, now explore that a little. Confident enough? Great, find another canonical source for SPAs. ng-book is great if you want to do angular (and I&#x27;m sure their react book is just as solid). Done all the examples in the book and feel confident?

If Homer Simpson messes up at the fusion plant, the reaction will just stop. Why? Because for fusion to happen, the atoms (hydrogens) need to overcome their electrostatic repulsion of eachother - the Coulomb barrier generated by the protons in the nuclei (at fusion temps the atoms have all become ionized - electrons have shot off from the atoms, so you have electrons and positively charged nuclei flying around - aka a charged gas aka a plasma).</p><p>Anyway that coulomb force has the same dependence on distance as gravity (1&#x2F;r^2) - but unlike gravity - is a repulsive force. If you can force the atoms close enough together (by putting them under high temperature and pressure) then they will be close enough that the nuclei of the atoms will be pulled together by a stronger <i>attractive</i> force - the nuclear force - which only works at a very short range. As mentioned, you have to get the atoms going really fast and really close together for this to happen (put the gas under high temp and pressure, which incidentally will ionize the gas atoms into electrons and positively charged ions).</p><p>The fact that it is now &#x27;electric&#x27; is the key to both approaches (tokamak and stellarator) at containing the plasma. These are just two approaches at Magnetically Confined Fusion, which operates on the simple principle that charged particles (both electrons and the ions that you are trying to fuse w other ions) travel along magnetic field lines. They spin in tight little circles around magnetic field lines, the stronger the magnetic field, the tighter the circle. Tokamak, which is simpler than a stellarator, is basically a solenoid <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Solenoid\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Solenoid</a> that wraps around into a donut shape. Just as the magnetic field lines in a solenoid go along the length of the solenoid, the magnetic field lines in a tokamak will go around the donut (toroidal field). Just imagine that the tokamak magnets are really powerful so the magnetic field lines (not really lines) are really strong - then your ions will gyrate around and bump into other ions that are gyrating around B-lines. There are problems though.</p><p>It&#x27;s been a while since I studied but basically, in addition to ions and electrons very fast giration around the magnetic field &#x27;line&#x27; and it&#x27;s slower movement along the field line (around the donut) - it also &#x27;drifts&#x27; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Guiding_center\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Guiding_center</a> - this is the slowest movement. There are a few mechanisms that cause this drift, but to the great misfortune of mankind, these drifts are &#x27;out&#x27; - the ions drift away from the plasma core, and towards the wall of the tokamak.</p><p>To stop this drift from happening, you need the toroidal (around the donut) B field lines to also twist, so they look like a twizzler that has been wrapped around on itself. In a tokamak this is generally done by running a current through the plasma around the donut. Plasmas are highly conductive, so you can do this. It is like a big coil of wire. Just like the coils on a solenoid generate a straight B field through the center of a solenoid, and the coils of a tokamak (donut shaped solenoid) generate a donut shaped B field, running a current through the donut shaped plasma will generate a B field from the ceiling to the floor thru the donut hole (the poloidal field). The poloidal and toroidal fields vector add to make your twirly twizzler shaped field that prevents drifts. This running a current thru the plasma is how you &#x27;twist&#x27; the field in tokamaks.</p><p>Stellerators, on the other hand, generate the field with complex (very) magnetic configuration (look up images of WX-7). There is no need to run current thru the plasma, and this in theory, and I think now in practice, with WX-7, leads to a more stable plasma. This stability issue is very important. Scientists have known about drifts since year 0 of fusion research, but there are many instabilities that cause the plasma to break down.</p><p>As mentioned in the article - there is a triple product that basically describes the success of the plasma - plasma density, plasma temperature and confinement time. This is more or less equivalent to &#x27;are we getting more energy out than we are putting in&#x27; and I believe the advantage of stellerator would be confinement time. Hopefully these brainiacs can get it happening.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13150070,"story_id":13149902,"children":[]},{"id":13151088,"children":[]},{"id":13151090,"children":[]},{"id":13150080,"created_at_i":1481442901,"type":"comment","author":"germinalphrase","text":"<p>Yes - I would appreciate the ELI5</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13150070,"story_id":13149902,"children":[]},{"id":13150086,"created_at_i":1481443114,"type":"comment","author":"ars","text":"<p>Sure.</p><p>If you squish hydrogen atoms together hard enough, and hot enough, they release energy.</p><p>But it needs to be really really hot - so hot that anything you made it out of would melt.</p><p>So what do you do?</p><p>You use a magnet.

And there are some companies that have contracts like that with some software vendors -- presumably in aerospace and so on.

And you better hope none of your customers are large corporations that could potentially suffer even bigger losses, even though the software developer has no control over that at all.</p><p>A big part of the problem here is that we keep trying to <i>shield</i> the users from liability, but they&#x27;re the ones who make the decisions.

But we should look at software freedom with consequentialist eyes: the ends, the good or evil done to people, justify or condemn the means, whether that good or evil can be done with the software at hand. <i>Generally</i> one can do more good, or at least be assured of fighting evil, with free software. But that does not mean that free software itself is an intrinsic moral good.</p><p>Related, I think, is Mako&#x27;s 2011 essay &quot;Freedom for Users, Not for Software&quot;: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wealthofthecommons.org&#x2F;essay&#x2F;freedom-users-not-software\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wealthofthecommons.org&#x2F;essay&#x2F;freedom-users-not-softwa...</a></p><p>But in practice, that ends up being more of a defense of the AGPL than a call for social action - and the AGPL, if widely adopted, would  make the goal of using only free software even more of a burden (since it is GPL-incompatible). The FSF seemed to recognize an actual problem well worth solving, but address it through the tool they were comfortable with, writing licenses. (And the minimal adoption of the AGPL indicates that this didn&#x27;t actually solve problems, so per consequentialism, we must admit that the AGPL did at most minimal social good.)</p><p>It&#x27;s also worth talking about the resources required to make effective use of free software; freedom #4 is only realistic if you can actually make the changes. If Chrome OS (to take Mako&#x27;s example) can be effectively hacked on by the second-largest company in the world, but much less effectively by an individual, is that really better than the closed-source OS which only the largest company in the world can hack on? And has free software really changed the social order for the better, compared to the pre-software days?</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13147560,"story_id":13147560,"children":[{"id":13148898,"created_at_i":1481417048,"type":"comment","author":"milesrout","text":"<p>&gt;Free software isn&#x27;t a moral good in itself, and non-free software isn&#x27;t a moral evil in itself;</p><p>I disagree.

But, something about Stallman that made it hard for me to really take his movement seriously enough to want to take up his banner and follow him, and I think this article hit on why.  He is  right about the problem but there&#x27;s a flaw in his approach to solving the problem.</p><p>While Stallman is right in asserting that software should be free, he moves into Zealotry in insisting that he only use free software and thereby excluding himself from much of the technology available today.

Debian contains a lot of GNU software, as well as the Linux kernel, but also contains a whole lot of Debian-specific software (most notably dpkg and apt), as well as other software (for example, X.org). If we compare, Fedora contains a lot of the same software as Debian, but also a whole lot of Red Hat-developed Red Hat-specific software (again, it&#x27;s RPM, dnf, but also things like flatpak which is not specific to any one operating system).</p><p>Why do people insist on saying that all of this is one single &quot;operating system&quot; called &quot;GNU&#x2F;Linux&quot; and that there are different &quot;distros&quot; called Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, Arch, etc., instead of just calling it all a bunch of operating systems? Because these different &quot;distros&quot; are not compatible with each other. They can mostly run each other&#x27;s binaries, and some configuration knowledge works across them, but other than that they are mostly incompatible. And they are all based on Linux, GNU, and a bunch of non-GNU software.</p><p>So if we say that &quot;This is an operating system called Fedora, which is based on Linux and GNU and a bunch of other stuff&quot;, instead of &quot;This is a distribution of the operating system GNU&#x2F;Linux called Fedora&quot; then we would just be better off overall. There is no more reason to fight over the name &quot;GNU&#x2F;Linux&quot; versus &quot;Linux&quot; since both are pretty inaccurate anyway. There would be no more user confusion about what Linux is, as there seems to be today (e.g. people blame Linux for userland problems, or people expect program X to be packaged and get support for operating system Y because it says &quot;Linux&quot; on the webpage). And things like BSD would seem less foreign if people knew that it&#x27;s really another operating system instead of being seen as just some weird non-Linux thing.</p><p>And if the GNU people ever get around to actually finish their operating system, then they could just call it &quot;GNU&quot; without causing even more confusion</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13151513,"story_id":13147560,"children":[]},{"id":13152185,"created_at_i":1481479330,"type":"comment","author":"smonff","text":"<p>&gt;Free software should be an integrated part of a wider movement for emancipation</p><p>This is actually what FSF claims to do as far as I understand.

They shout slogans such as “Supply and Demand!”  “Capitalism”! “  “Let the markets work!”  However, for anyone who actually read Adam Smith, you would note that the “invisible hand” was not his only observation of the inner workings of capitalism.  Adam Smith recognized that many in the economy were making gobs of money, but weren’t contributing anything.  He was referring to what was eventually called “economic rent”.</p><p>Smith observed that all production required 3 things.  Land, Capital, and Labor.  A very simple example would be a brick factory.  The building and oven needed to create the bricks are the “capital” – the owners are the capitalists.  The people making the bricks is the “labor” – the people doing the actual work.  The Land the factory occupies and the clay used to make the bricks is the “land” – the owners of the land are the “Rentiers”.  Any money made by selling the bricks is then divided up between these three groups: the rentiers, the capitalists, and the workers.</i></p><p>Where many here on HN and I will differ is what forms of passive income are rent seeking rather value creating applications of the output of one&#x27;s previous labor.</p><p>Note that you can even be pro-Capitalism and anti-rent-seeking: <i>How Economists Duped Us into Attacking Capitalism Instead of Parasitic Rent-Seeking</i> <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;evonomics.com&#x2F;economists-duped-attacking-capitalism&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;evonomics.com&#x2F;economists-duped-attacking-capitalism&#x2F;</a></p>","points":null,"parent_id":13152309,"story_id":13150144,"children":[]}]},{"id":13152762,"created_at_i":1481485692,"type":"comment","author":"sheriffderek","text":"<p>I think the flaw in the system is land&#x2F;personal property.

A few comments from me and a link to some of what I&#x27;ve done and how they have done in 2016:</p><p>- Rich Dad, Poor Dad got me into the idea of &#x27;passive&#x27; income. Nothing is truly passive of course, but it makes me think about what I do</p><p>- SourceGuardian. This is encryption software I set up in 2002 as I had a need myself and the nearest product was $6000 at the time. It has generated a great passive income since then. Enough to pay all my bills. 2016 was no different. I work with 2 other people on it, one of whom I&#x27;ve never met (he&#x27;s in Russia) and it works well</p><p>- Competitor Monitor. This <i>used</i> to be a side-project 5 years ago, but it has grown significantly and in the past year we are up by 35% and we have grown our team. Strangely this has now become passive in the sense that I have created a structure and systemised the business (read The Emyth Revisited book) and that has allowed me to step out. I am not more of an investor than a day-to-day contributor</p><p>- UKscrap.com.  This one died in 2016. The site is still there, but competition and my lack of interest killed it</p><p>As I said, nothing is truly passive, but you need to have a passion for whatever you do and I would try to create a &#x27;passive index&#x27; for your ideas.

From when I started there are a HUGE number of resources to help you also.

I think they&#x27;re dead wrong but that&#x27;s how markets are made.</p><p>* the &quot;days to cover&quot; column means that if all the short sellers tried to close their position (ie, buy stock in the company), how many days would it take that to happen at an average day&#x27;s volume? this can be an indicator of companies ripe for a short squeeze, where a company announces unexpected good news and shorts rapidly try to close their position but not enough people want to sell and so the stock price skyrockets.

GOGO of Gogo inflight Wifi is listed at 43% float and 21 days to cover, but its borrow rates are around 8%. I don&#x27;t know why.</p><p>* in many cases, there is a short argument worth listening to and there&#x27;s a reason many people are shorting a stock. GoPro&#x2F;GPRO is currently paying <i>86%</i> for people to lend out their shares to short sellers. You could buy GoPro and lend out your shares but then you run the risk of owning GoPro and it&#x27;s a big question mark how big that risk is. I face that same risk in owning Tesla, but I think the short argument is garbage and I really believe in the company and that&#x27;s enough for me.</p><p>* the tesla situation was kind of a perfect storm because it has a lot of fervent believers on both sides. companies that people are really passionate about might be hard to come by.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13152183,"story_id":13150144,"children":[{"id":13152657,"created_at_i":1481484403,"type":"comment","author":"durkie","text":"<p>also, as a side anecdote about short squeezes: people were really expecting one these past few months with Tesla regarding its SolarCity merger.

Not to mention the extra cost and risk of opening an account outside your country; for instance, the Brazilian customer protection laws won&#x27;t apply to an account outside the country, for obvious reasons. All in all, it&#x27;s a lot more research to do, with the extra risk of investing outside your home jurisdiction, for a much smaller return, and the only benefit being reducing your exposition to your own government - one I&#x27;ll be always exposed to, since I live here (it could easily impose taxes on capital held abroad, for instance).</p><p>&gt; But surely that&#x27;s the interest rate that their central bank charges to the banks (which influences the interest rates banks pay&#x2F;charge for savings&#x2F;loans with them), not the interest rate that they are paying on their own government bonds?

Finally, one of the government bonds (the LFT) pays the principal ajusted by the SELIC rate at its term.

German laws demand that all stuff has to work properly for at least 2 years, if used correctly by the user.</p><p>So when I phoned Google about fixing that button I also mentioned that I had a crack in the display, but the display was working perfectly fine, and what I want them to fix is obviously only the button that&#x27;s been a big issue on the internet and not related to the display crack, and not fix the display. Google then proceeded to tell me, that their warranty would not cover that, I need first to get the display fixed on my own cost, before they would fix the button (which they admitted is definitely a manufacturing defect).\nThis is absurd. Here&#x27;s a shitty analogy: Imagine you buy a toaster, and it&#x27;s button stops working. You also made a minor scratch on it&#x27;s hull. So the company making the toaster refuses to fix it&#x27;s button unless you fix that scratch first. Ridiculous.</p><p>German legal stuff: In Germany, you have two choices when your product shows a manufacturing defect before the two years are over: Demand a brand new product, or a demand a repair from the dealer (not the manufactorer, thank god I bought my nexus at the play store and not at some shitty dealer). If two repairs don&#x27;t fix your product or the dealer declines to fix&#x2F;give you a new product you may demand the (usually) full price back.</p><p>Let&#x27;s call this German 2-year-protection the legal warranty. There is some minor stuff involved about proving that it actually is a manufacturer defect (first half year the dealer has to prove it isn&#x27;t, last one and a half years you have to prove that it is), but this wasn&#x27;t an issue as Google had already confirmed to me that it indeed is a manufacturers defect, which I had asked them to confirm me in an email. Some dealers may try to trick you demanding expensive 3rd party surveys of the problem during that second phase where you have to prove it, thus scaring many customers away from executing their rights. Sadly this works in many cases, while the only &#x27;proof&#x27; you would actually need is to say that you always used the device to its specifications, an expensive 3rd survey is just overkill.</p><p>So, what Google does is, they offer an additional, voluntary guarantee (I&#x27;m gonna call it like this because in German it is called &quot;Garantie&quot;, while it usually in English is called warranty, to differentiate from the legal warranty which we call &quot;Gewährleistung&quot;). That&#x27;s that little booklet that you usually find in the original package of your phone saying something along the lines of &#x27;warranty for some stuff, but not water damage and not broken displays&#x27;.\nGerman laws say that additional, voluntary guarantees like this are super awesome and totally allowed and stuff but they may never touch any rights that you have from that legal two-year-warranty.</p><p>So, Googles process of executing their additional guarantee is usually that they immediately send you a brand new&#x2F;refurbished phone, while you have a couple of weeks to send them your old one. They require you to provide a credit card, and it will be charged full price of a new phone if you don&#x27;t send your old one in&#x2F;it happens to not fulfill their requirements for their additional guarantee (this is pretty brash imo btw, personally I used an empty prepaid credit card in case they were going to bitch about my phone when I finally was allowed to send it in).</p><p>Note that they do not have implemented a process to handle repairs. You will always get a different, brand new&#x2F;refurbished phone than your old one. And this is where they clash with German law. While I theoretically could be a bitch and demand them to repair my specific device, and get the full price back because they wouldn&#x27;t be able to, I did not. I said I&#x27;m willing to adapt to their existing processes, and allow them to send me that brand new&#x2F;refurbished phone instead of doing a prefered repair.\nThis conveniently would also mean I get a crack free display as a result of the process. But that is not my fault. I&#x27;d have been happy to have only the button repaired, but it&#x27;s entirely Google fault that this was not possible.</p><p>So, the clerks at the phone were trying to keep me from sending that phone in, because Google doesn&#x27;t want to eat all these probably very frequent display damages, while it is their own fault that they do. Also not a single of the phone clerks I reached (3 calls in total over several weeks) did knew of that legal two-year warranty, they were always refusing to give me a retour label or even an address to manually send the phone in referencing their additional guarantee that does not cover display damage (which, again, I was always emphasizing, was not what I wanted to be repaired). All of them admitted that they had not been taught about the German law of legal warranty, not even the supervisors.</p><p>So what I did is I set up a registered letter citing all the paragraphs by which I demanded a repair, or if not possible a new device, or if not possible my money back. Weeks of phoning did nothing, but two days after sending the letter I had that retour label without further comment in my inbox and everything went smoothly after that (with additional precaution of mine using an empty prepaid card; pretty sure that practice of Google is illegal by German laws too, but I had my low effort work around).</p><p>This happened during the fall of 2015. Refurbished phone is working alright. Additional benefit for the customer of getting a new device instead of a repair: your legal two-year warranty is reset.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13145400,"story_id":13145400,"children":[{"id":13145963,"created_at_i":1481382849,"type":"comment","author":"npstr","text":"<p>To clarify the display was not &quot;broken&quot;, it was really just a crack, it&#x27;s performance was not hampered at all.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13145921,"story_id":13145400,"children":[{"id":13146112,"created_at_i":1481384620,"type":"comment","author":"bflesch","text":"<p>This should be a Verbraucherschutz court case in Germany.

Park the domains with Google instead and get paid 100% of the virtually nonexistent revenue. So this guy decided &quot;Why have a middleman?&quot; and moved all of his domains to the &quot;Google for Domains&quot; service.  This entailed listing them with Google and changing to the provided DNS. As you listed the domains Google went through some sort of a check and approved every single one of them. Presumably they didn&#x27;t want obscene sounding domains or something like that (even though they -presumably- supported anything GoDaddy would thrown at them).</p><p>Three days later all of his Google accounts are suspended. The claim was &quot;unexpected click activity&quot; on the ads they placed on these domains. In other words, click fraud.</p><p>So, here&#x27;s Google accusing a guy --who is doing 7 figures a year with his real business-- of clicking some ads to earn, what, twenty-three cents?  The whole thing was surreal beyond all description.</p><p>Why did he do this if he didn&#x27;t need to?  Because he wanted to get the hell out of GoDaddy and when this announcement for &quot;Google for Domains&quot; came across his email he told his web person to just move all the domains away from GoDaddy parking.

All the large web companies have such contempt for their users that they behave in totalitarian fashion and offer no sensible mechanisms for customer service or conflict resolution.</p><p>For example, if you advertise with Facebook, have no experience and run afoul of some of their nebulous rules your FB ads account could be permanently suspended or closed down. Again, just as the Google case, there is no real path to resolution. You can send in a form that probably ends-up in the hands of a petulant 24 year old child with no manners and devoid of the ability to deal with real human beings and get back a totalitarian &quot;your account is permanently suspended&quot; reply that helps nobody.

This was on the retail hardware side rather than in software&#x2F;services (IDK if there are different support depts., I would assume so).

Called support (which was, to my surprise, easy to find an actual phone number for, and I was speaking to an actual human being. Probably because this was &#x27;retail&#x27; related), and after 1 phone conversation and 2 email exchanges he filed a case with FedEx - which required no involvement from me - and i was sent a replacement free of charge. About a week later my across-the-street neighbor knocks on my door and gives me a FedEx package with my name and address on it, it was the Chromecast. Turns out the FedEx delivery driver mistakenly delivered it to his house, which has only a 1-digit difference in Address. Honest mistake, it happens. I e-mail the support guy I talked with before -- to my surprise again, this was a direct e-mail address of his, not a randomly generated &#x27;post only&#x27; email, so he actually responded. I explained the situation, and asked where I should ship the replacement one they sent back to. They tell me to just keep it and do whatever I want with it (the guy even specifically said &quot;give it away, sell it on eBay, do whatever&quot;). Granted, it&#x27;s only a $35 device, and it likely costs Google far less than that, but still - I did appreciate it, and my sister does as well because she got a free Chromecast.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13145400,"story_id":13145400,"children":[]},{"id":13147023,"created_at_i":1481394245,"type":"comment","author":"davidf18","text":"<p>Very sorry to hear anyone going through this kind of trouble, but at least for US users and most readers of HN, they should be getting up-to-date iPhones on the Verizon network.</p><p>The costs are minimal and it helps to avoid hassles.

I like that mechanic, just didn&#x27;t realize how it worked at first. Overall, love the mechanics of the game, just needs a little better tutorial and cleaning up the selection commands (would prefer a different key to split the army, like pressing &quot;h&quot; for example).

It won&#x27;t give you a sensible odds ratio like 10, it&#x27;ll give you an OR of ∞, because if the OR is ∞, that maximizes the chance of perfect separation since the likelihood of separation is always 1 and any finite OR would imply a slightly smaller likelihood &lt;1.

From what I can tell, the multi-process architecture in Python would require everything you mentioned. Not removing the GIL is indeed unfortunate.</p><p>Clojure is niche in a way. It is a Lisp dialect. However, it is based on the JVM and has built-in conveniences for using Java functions, classes, and libraries. Therefore, comparing libraries for enterprise applications is more accurately Clojure+Java vs. Python. My expertise is not in either language ecosystem, but my impression is that Python has better libraries for data analysis and as a system scripting language, and Clojure+Java is better for general applications and everything else.</p><p>One benefit of Clojure that makes parallelization easy is the immutable data structures. New data structures are cheaply made by seamlessly referencing originating data structures. Example: making a copy of array A and appending an item as array B, means that array B is mostly a reference to array A. Immutable data structures also offer expectations of behavior that mutable state naturally offends, such as avoiding race conditions or locks. In the case of my earlier example, I simply added some &quot;future&quot; wrapper functions and &quot;dereference&quot; annotations [1]. The entire program would execute to reach the final output, then work in reverse order to trigger and plan the future functions. Order of execution was based on dependencies, not strictly on the order of the code. It was fascinating was to watch the logs for when functions would start or complete.

As in a truly bright kid with no social skills, is not one I think with a social deficiency, just they were not able to find links emotionally at a suitable pace for them.</p><p>I cannot imagine anything worse (or just difficult) than a mind on over drive, supercharged, forming its first connections without having a fall back safety of comfort and peace and reassurance in the atmosphere it finds. Nobody can manufacture perfect atmospheres or emotional moods, but I dare to suggest - as a point of reference at least, my father tried with some success - that meditation and related ideas might help you project the emotional calm which could provide an important means for your infant to retreat into the safety of emotional needs, and attachment to you, as parents.</p><p>I think I didn&#x27;t get how many paths there are to making things feel right, and thought people were much more complex than they were. I imagined I had to make things just so, or nobody would be happy. Whilst simultaneously being told by adults I was unusually complicated little child, that made me miss so much I could have done with learning solidly, then. Unfortunately, my history was sadly littered with unfortunate events that distinctly did not assist me in self evaluation, so I may have had a more tricky time than others.</p><p>My father would every now and then declare something like &quot;I give up you are too annoyingly difficult for me to solve&quot;, and shut whatever he was reading, and there would be a wonderful change in the atmosphere for all of us. He did know he had to give up, also, stop fretting I mean, just wasn&#x27;t so great at it. He would act out those gestures with exaggerated relief, and pursue something impromptu we&#x27;d all enjoy, probably carefully prepared but who would care. He would clearly be relieved and appear delighted himself, as if he had &quot;solved&quot; me. We just loved he&#x27;d stopped worrying. Like they say acting out happy, even just standing the way you do when say joyous at your team scoring, triggers the emotion itself. I reckon that learning about acting, about body language improv, tones of voice etc are super useful tools in parenting. (and lots of fun, potentially, too)</p><p>The hardest thing I always can see some parents find, if I ask, or chat with or observe, is they think they make mistakes with overmuch significance. I want to joke now, that if your child gets too far ahead in learning, slow them down with existential philosophy, and ask why they know anything they appear to claim as knowledge. One of the happiest people I grew up around, said her father constantly took the mickey out of her, when she was little. Humor, with the ingredients of counter-factuals and questions of comprehension, is obviously a great socializing influence, and I truly am jealous of your predicament in one sense, that I would love to watch such a child grow up appreciating subjects thab vnt adults so poorly understand, humor in particular a important one to me, as well as interesting from a mental development, theory of mind and so on, as well.</p><p>If I may suggest one last thing, it is when I am talking through any problem with someone really stressed long term by the problem&#x27;s intractability, I make sure to go over every last detail, several times different takes. I find that by being completely thorough, and running over detail with differing but complimentary thoughts, my friend rarely gets stressed again right away because they suddenly remark, &quot;but you forgot about x, we&#x27;re doomed&quot;. Oh, and when the problem is anxiety or worry not solving a actual problem (very much the case with female friends, or anyone inclined to use indirect speech) I try only to generalize that other perspectives exist, and find complimentary paths through &quot;the data&quot;, because the main thing is to get someone &quot;unstuck&quot; from e.g. circular thoughts. Saying that because I think you could do well to review who is best to turn to, when you do need advice, and I learned this technique&#x2F;habit from someone who helped me the most, and I think when truly worried deeply (as one always is about a child&#x27;s development) then at the time you are worried, just I wouldn&#x27;t want to hear any &quot;actual answers&quot; or advice, because i&#x27;d be in a bad place to evaluate real useful information or views. I figure I can always ask again or in the morning, but it&#x27;s not great to hold on to ideas of fixes to longstanding problems, when you are low about them. If you can, try to assemble and nurture friends and colleagues with the &quot;basic equipment&quot; you need around you, and make sure to evaluate, alongside your wife, what you both think of the quality and value of such support, if you do find it useful. (From experience, I must say when it comes to kids, social factors are really important, who advises can become more important than any other factor, in-laws usually teach you this son as your baby is born, but it’s worth noting more widely, how political advice about child rearing can be, and having a strategy to appreciate that can help reduce stress, get more people onboard, avoid comments such as “no wonder he’s stressed about your baby, just look what he’s doing!. Irrational, sure, but human stuff like this demands proactive approaches) I sincerely doubt I could be of any help or guidance, but since the related areas have been very much on my mind, a good while, I&#x27;d be delighted to _try, or be a sounding board, if you felt someone out of the loop appropriate, and I&#x27;ll add my email to my profile, if you wish, by reply. (Literally only if you thought there was some unlikely lead in my comment, or a once in blue moon exchange might offer a alternate thread to follow, but I feel I’m merely flattering myself by offering, it’s just your use of words and seriousness of problem, the way you put it, well if you are as concerned, I read HN daily, and will check for any replies, the subject is real close to me)</p><p>I really do think we get early development sorely wrong, generally, for kids with exceptional absolute or relative ability. I mean, in the sense of we are missing something, even maybe for a reason like cognitive dissonance, or something actually simple we&#x27;ve not considered. My line of inquiry is into how &quot;hard&quot; intellectual tasks are versus emotional &quot;reasoning&quot;. Just Friday, chat came up about the kind of rehabilitation courses they put felons through, typically titles such as &quot;emotional reasoning&quot;, and my argument was that if we got emotions right, they wouldn&#x27;t require &quot;artificial&quot; reasoning, that we need a more direct interface or language, or means to learn to control without reasoning, as evidenced by breathing exercises e.g.. The subject is beyond me, but it&#x27;s one I will continue to try to study, as it does seem vital to me, one day, hopefully. It’s with the same level of hope, that I do hope I may have added something, however little, of use to your efforts. If nothing else, please take this away: I so wish my pop ever asked or was able to ask what best to do about me, on HN or something like it back in the day, so I&#x27;m rotten jealous of your parenting, as a adult and a grown up child!

Another issue, but when my mom reached her eighties, I found she couldn&#x27;t engage with &quot;adult talk&quot;, but all I had to do to get her engaging, was intone my voice as I would more a child: I realized she needed the emotional connection, but still understood the rest just fine. Maybe she was excluding the unfamiliar, a natural response to age and frailty which would make her feel unsafe outside family.</p><p>I couldn&#x27;t find the word, earlier, but if I was plotting a critical path analysis for verbal engagement conducted by a mentally and linguistically 10 year old, if this was about understanding emotional contexts, there would be far greater homomorphisms in the chart I plotted, than if I was testing a child for ability to appreciate e.g. related concepts or word &#x2F; idea groupings. In theory, basic emotion is simpler, but there are more paths being evaluated by a more advanced child, before life experience catches up to their intellectual age, and we measure intelligence not on the basis of finding routes to a very few states, but in way we measure intelligence by ability to distinguish paths, outcomes, and differences. We emphasize the differences, and I question whether when a child wants to know how she will feel, in any given situation, this emphasis on different paths through thought, creates a sense of dislocation or remoteness from comforting emotional states. I think this is the &quot;big wide world, big scary wide world, effect&quot; when our minds boggle at, say, a first sight of a major landscape or city map. There at that many possibilities, and we don&#x27;t know how we feel about them. And that is us as adults.</p><p>(I didn&#x27;t mean to pretend i know anything serious behind my ideas, just remembered some words that seemed to help describe my thought.)</p><p>So I&#x27;m harping on about something quite narrow here, about whether we mess up, for example by pushing kids with potential amid a tense or stressful atmosphere, among parents whose love may be felt conditional on performance (and teachers can be vile, one friend&#x27;s daughter had half her school problems turn out to be ridiculous expectations from one teacher, in the one class she excelled in, so they let her flunk almost every class and this teacher pushed her, &quot;or prove she&#x27;s not stupid or lazy and just disrupting the other classes&quot; -- sorry letting off steam, the kid&#x27;s got dyslexia, not known a the time, but was killing it in history because of older family providing 24&#x2F;7 oral histories at home..) anyhow, trying to return to pre-school..</p><p>For myself, this is when things happened for me, just I didn&#x27;t get <i>that</i> memory back! So I&#x27;m reconstructing thoughts best I can...</p><p>One friend, a retired head teacher, firmly believed 5 thru 8 are most important. But I believe the 3 or 4 years before then, really are, just not educationally, but obviously affecting education.</p><p>I think exposure to adult age ranges is so important, in pre-school years. I grew up in a retirement resort demographic, small town, and exposure to friendly seniors did wonders for my social development, which was still lacking or notably disjointed well into my life. I was constantly challenged, learning how to help folk do gardening, not chores but proper growing and planting etc, whch i loved, and ettung what elderly folk want done, the right way for them is a particular skill. That was specifically very useful, later, comprehending nuanced instructions.</p><p>I realize my childhood had some lucky, even idyllic, parts to it. I have been trying to understand my life&#x27;s calamities linking directly back to education an parenting, pretty much forever.</p><p>But back to this: unstructured, semi -formal engagement, and if it can be provided with individual attention, providing a variety of situations, contexts, people, challenges...</p><p>If I could create such a possibility for every child, I would, and I would require parents pushing still to my view infants, through formal education plans at that age, to justify themselves formally, before being allowed.</p><p>Social exploration, then, is even more valuable to your daughter, in my book.</p><p>If there is any way to find her friends who are older, approach parents whose kids need babysitting jobs, with the none too subtle, &quot;you should be paying us for tuition&quot; pitch, ,... No, I&#x27;m serious, if not serious I&#x27;d say it just like that! Young girls like to help, appreciate the role and status that that attracts to them in society, so as and when such a time comes, sell the idea as the status symbol it really is. Oh, and older kids have better toys, wondering if the older play date can supervise tablet access responsibly or not..</p><p>I can&#x27;t tell from your comment, what nature your daughter&#x27;s inquiry and inquisitiveness assumes, what direction it takes, whether you have local resources whether countryside or a town with a high young parent demographic, and so I&#x27;ve no idea how you are reaching limits. (Not no idea how you reached a limit, just no idea in what ways possibilities may be limited or available)</p><p>The key thing is what human resources do you have?</p><p>If your and your wife&#x27;s parents are far away, I&#x27;m not joking, change that! If you&#x27;ve a brother sister or cousin house sharing in the same city, and could persuade them with cheaper rent or such like, get them moving in!</p><p>My friend&#x27;s daughter, who was wowing everyone with her history appreciations, even if they were plagiarised, they were not Wikipedia rip offs, but from her own aural comprehension, is now a 15yr old right little miss, and trouble smouldering into her teen years, but when she was oh simply a whole other level of hard work - and it turns out basically her education was updended by late diagnosis for dyslexia, there&#x27;s major trouble now in progressing her at all, I&#x27;m livid and still speechless how her school was run -  I&#x27;ve known with varying degrees of social life bringing me around her parents, from when she was 2 and a half I think now, and almost shocking in her advanced and precocious demand for insights, was immeasurably helped by the variety of people in her immediate environments at home, which was a long while a larger home only ad hoc divided into apartments shared by colleagues of her dad, nobody strange at all, but a constant input from ages of 20 through 70, whom she overwhelmed with demands for what I now realize so belatedly, and not unmeassurable anger, she was unable from at school.</p><p>Yet if I have to take her any place, I immediately found a completely charming, curious, engaging, character who made me feel rotten good, when moms in parks complimented me on my friends&#x27; daughters&#x27; good behaviour. Because she was a delight of proper manners and politeness, on her own, around me. Just back home, chaos resumes. Since she has been analyzing her parents (all agree that is a vital nsurvival skill for her her since burth),usuallywhisoering excuses for them in my ear, I say she&#x27;d make a useful sociologist. Just the retaking a year at school...</p><p>I can only think, after all that, if you could move to a community where kids can get about, like I did, in our small home town (I doubt you could now, though, this was really when  we rarely locked front doors), a gated community even, or if you have links to a church possibly...</p><p>We teach parents and sticvtly define in pomotional society how they are supposed to cope with everything all prim and proper, an aligned with neat values and formalized &quot;advancement&quot; I prefer to call it, even if merely &quot;progression&quot; is the uninspiring word i hear from  &quot;education professionals&quot;. But we are helped out so little what to do, in event we are faced with life unconventional in any way.</p><p>There surely must be some online - and real, physical,- communities who share experiences in wealth far beyond my little thoughts. The unmentioned benefit of my friend&#x27;s family living semi communally during a real tough time, was they had powerfully articulate advocates, when CP got called by a teacher with a ugly attitude and no good reason, one time, and though that nearly became a .., well a nightmare was averted, because CP couldn&#x27;t twist up two overloaded parents, as I&#x27;ve sadly seen happen a few other families suffer. I really doubt that sort of bonus is important or needed near you, but I mention it as how a little community real close to you, always defends its own. That safety and assurance, is priceless, i think when growing up. It&#x27;s the next 16 years of your life, I guess, so you can afford to plan slowly and act carefully, and administer cures sparingly since real problems rarely show overnight.</p><p>best wishes - j</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13146642,"story_id":13145853,"children":[]},{"id":13149426,"created_at_i":1481426651,"type":"comment","author":"mncharity","text":"<p>Some thoughts, with the caveat that it&#x27;s very not my field.</p><p>&gt; cannot keep up</p><p>Different approaches can have very different demands.

Or instead, you can support, and mentor, and be an example, and otherwise &quot;get out of the way&quot; -- smaller and more flexible effort.</p><p>My fuzzy recollection is, one reason families without a higher-ed background, have kids that achieve less, is that the parents are more likely to believe, and teach their kids, that education is something that school is going to do for you.  To you.  Rather than something you have to create for yourself.  With school sometimes helping, and often not.  So one hears of community college students, protesting in frustration &quot;I&#x27;ve paid you, so why haven&#x27;t you successfully taught me yet?&quot;  Interestingly, a similar issue shows up with Ivy League students, who have had excellent teachers presenting knowledge well, and now lack the motivation and skills, to themselves grapple with a body of knowledge, and wrestle understanding from it.  &quot;They expect me to spoon feed them&quot; an instructor said.  So the reason for mentioning this... perhaps thinking of yourself in a &quot;supportive&quot; role, rather than a &quot;school teacher&quot;-ish role, might be useful?</p><p>Also... I knew a toddler, with their own toddler-high kitchen snack shelf.  And they learned to pour cheerios, and water.  More or less neatly.  And two years later, that was all gone, and the parent was doing everything themselves.  Almost passive &quot;spoon feeding&quot;.  So both the learning had stopped, and the parent was more busy.  When young, so much can be a &quot;learning opportunity&quot;, that &quot;here&#x27;s a way to save time&quot;, can at least sometimes be made into one.

Grandma with walker can&#x27;t play tag in the park, but can read stories.  Some adults like talking with kids, and some don&#x27;t.  The librarian can talk about books, but can&#x27;t make you sandwich, or show you how to do it.  Some dogs you can pet, others only say hi to.  Some kids do and like talking about activity X, and others don&#x27;t care about X but like Y.  Which is frustrating when you want to do something particular, and the person at hand doesn&#x27;t.

Good student, got good grades with about zero effort, did good in extracurriculars, but found most academic-related things to be very boring (it was mostly memorization of facts with zero critical thinking).  Most of my friends worked menial jobs or sold drugs, and while I did graduate high school and stay out of serious trouble, instead of university I got a restaurant job and partied, abused alcohol and drugs and lived a pretty interesting life.  Excelled at work, rising to the top of the local food scene very quick, then got married and went to university at the behest of my wife who didn&#x27;t like the restaurant lifestyle.  Well, married life was boring, got restless, eventually we fell out and split (she wanted the white picket fence and everything, I wanted to just experience life with a fun partner), now I travel, gamble, trade stocks and sometimes will do a stint at restaurants my friends own just because it&#x27;s fun.  Oh, and programming, the wife hated that, she didn&#x27;t see the point in creating programs and scripts that didn&#x27;t &#x27;make money&#x27; (never mind all the stock-picking and economic-analyzing scripts that kind of did make me money...).</p><p>Guess the point is that a &#x27;typical&#x27; life isn&#x27;t for everyone.

It still drives, is warm in the winter, and has less problems.  I didn&#x27;t finish my degree?  Half my friends with degrees are unemployed now anyhow thanks to the shit local economy.
