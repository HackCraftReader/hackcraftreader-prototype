This is what Facebook and other companies did after maturing their security programs (see &quot;Facebook Onion&quot; on how Facebook transitioned away from MD5).</p><p>Also good to note - there is evidence Yahoo&#x27;s security culture improved over the years. The decision to go with MD5 almost certainly happened in the 90s, and when Tumblr suffered a breach all users were forced to reset their passwords. The capability and awareness was clearly there.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13180539,"story_id":13180101,"children":[]}]},{"id":13181323,"created_at_i":1481763263,"type":"comment","author":"rconti","text":"<p>You&#x27;re assuming engineering is just sitting on their thumbs, reviewing their code once a week, thinking of ways to optimize it.</p><p>In reality, they&#x27;re constantly under pressure to develop new features, fix reported bugs, move on to the next project, keep the site from falling over, etc etc.</p><p>And the ones who choose NOT to work hard aren&#x27;t sitting around reviewing old code either.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13180454,"story_id":13180101,"children":[]},{"id":13180820,"created_at_i":1481758615,"type":"comment","author":"gottam","text":"<p>Having worked with monolithic legacy codebases that they likely have, it has gone through hundreds of developers who dont work for the company anymore that created a bunch of spaghetti code means its a huge effort required to make sure that none of their other services break when they implement such changes.

For every individual investment they make, the chance of any sort of return is quite low; they make up for this because the rare startups that succeed make enough to compensate for this low success rate. Since they are making a lot of these high risk&#x2F;high reward &#x27;bets&#x27;, they can be fairly assured they will receive the expected value in return.</p><p>As an individual, you only get to place one bet on your employer. For most startup employees, that means they are very unlikely to get any sort of payout because of company success. It doesn&#x27;t matter that the &#x27;expected value&#x27; of working for a more-likely-to-hit-it-big startup is higher than for another company, since the probability is that you will not hit it big.</p><p>As an individual, you are more concerned with things like salary, working conditions, and personal enjoyment of the work. Those are the things you are CERTAINLY going to experience; the tiny chance of huge success is most likely not going to affect you.</p><p>I think there is a good analogy to poker here; in Texas Hold&#x27;em, two aces are the best starting hand.

One such case is if you are playing in a tournament, you are in the money, and two people with much larger stacks have already gone all-in. In that case, your best bet is likely to fold; even though you have the highest odds of winning the hand out of everyone, if you LOSE, you are out and can&#x27;t keep playing. Even if you win, you will still have the smallest stack and are unlikely to move up any spots and win more money; if you fold, though, someone else is likely to be knocked out and you can move up.</p><p>It seems counter intuitive, but this holds because expected value only works as your primary decision making point when you can make many bets; if you only get one bet, lower risk with lower reward is often better for you even if the expected value is lower.</p><p>Think about it this way; lets say you only have $1,000, and you need it to pay your monthly rent (if you don&#x27;t pay, you will be kicked out and be homeless). Someone comes up and offers you a bet; you bet $1000, and you get a 1% chance of winning $200,000. In terms of expected value, this is a great deal!

For what I want out of life, it absolutely made sense for me to move here - even with only $2K in cash, no job, and no place to live at first.</p><p>I came here for the things you can&#x27;t easily put a price on - like the weather, local arts, music, and culture. Also driving into the mountains, or down the coast of California. Chicago is no slouch for fun but cold days like this make me glad I&#x27;m not waiting for the &#x27;L&#x27; outside anymore. SF weather is generally magical.</p><p>Being in a top US city still gets me direct, reasonably priced, and frequently scheduled nonstop flights to family&#x2F;friends in places like Chicago, Cincinnati, Los Angeles, Seattle - not always attainable in some of these smaller tech hubs (like Portland, or Austin.)</p><p>When people move here, there is a constant worry about how much money they will make or what company they work for - I didn&#x27;t sweat it.</p><p>Within a month after arriving, I landed a great career. I spent the last two years exploring other hobbies and interests, and nurturing healthy new friendships.</p><p>Biggest tip I can give - It&#x27;s nice to get to know people who&#x27;ve been around here for a while, they&#x27;ve seen it all before. Show an interest in your local community. Volunteer your time but branch out of tech. Get to know people here in all walks of life; show compassion You just may be liked enough by some old school San Franciscans that refer you to one of their friends; who rent you their old place (with parking and views on Twin Peaks) for $1200. It worked for me.</p><p>San Francisco is not an expensive city because of tech alone, it&#x27;s always been a bit on the expensive side; as there&#x27;s no place in America like it.</p><p>Of course this is my experience. I merely bring it up just as a reminder that there&#x27;s so many things to focus on when decide whether or not moving here is worth it. The questions that guided me in my decision to move here were:</p><p>What are my goals long-term? \nWhat made me decide to move here? \nWhat is my contribution to the local community and society - outside of working in tech? \nWill I ultimately grow as a person; both personally and professionally?\nIs there enough other activities around that will keep me from being bored that I&#x27;ll enjoy?</p><p>My $.02.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13178305,"story_id":13178305,"children":[{"id":13179745,"created_at_i":1481750254,"type":"comment","author":"seikatsu","text":"<p>Hear-hear on &quot;there&#x27;s more to life than money&quot;, but would still argue many of the things you list (&quot;weather, local arts, music, culture&quot;) can be quantified to far larger extent than most bother.</p><p>Here&#x27;s one attempt, as an appropriate illustration for the Bay Area: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;teleport.org&#x2F;cities&#x2F;san-francisco-bay-area&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;teleport.org&#x2F;cities&#x2F;san-francisco-bay-area&#x2F;</a>\n(skip the top for startups, worst for housing and unfold the leisure, culture and tolerance categories, for example).</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13179338,"story_id":13178305,"children":[]},{"id":13179598,"created_at_i":1481749198,"type":"comment","author":"rconti","text":"<p>Well, their entire goal was to determine whether or not it was affordable&#x2F;made financial sense..

There are people counting hundreds or even thousands of votes in every precinct. Then from there they are publicly announced, and then anyone and everyone can tally up the totals.</p><p>The more people that vote, the more precincts there are, so the amount that any one person or place is responsable for (even only partially) is kept small so that mistakes or &quot;bad actors&quot; can only do a very small amount of damage on their own.</p><p>And if you read down in this submission a bit, people are pointing out that some countries (namely Switzerland) not only encourage people to watch ballot boxes and count along, but actually &quot;draft&quot; people to do it similar to a jury-duty kind of thing in the US.</p><p>Also I think you are severely underestimating the difficulty of auditing code. For starters, it completely removes the ability for the vast majority of the population to audit even if they wanted to. non-programmers can&#x27;t read programming. Not to mention the illiterate, the elderly, and anyone else that doesn&#x27;t have the knowledge to be able to read and follow a programming language.</p><p>Then there&#x27;s the amount of time it takes. Watching a ballot box takes the duration of the election day. A day at most. Auditing every inch of a codebase? Months, years, even longer. You can point out that not everyone has to review every single line, but then you are back to letting a fraction of a percent of the population validate the code (and in a ballot box system, you can have everyone validate the process, adding magnitudes more redundancy that something shady will be caught). And what percentage of programmers do you think have a good enough grasp on cryptographic protocols and voting systems to be able to correctly and securely vet a system like this? I&#x27;d be willing to bet good money there are less than a thousand of them in the united states, and by sheer (un)luck at least one of them will be a &quot;bad actor&quot;.</p><p>But probably the biggest thing is that to sway a &quot;paper and pencil&quot; election, you need materials, you need a LOT of people, and all it takes is one person to see what&#x27;s going on and it all collapses. If you&#x27;re really clever, you <i>might</i> be able to get away with changing the outcome of a single precinct, but what about the rest of the county? the state? the nation? In 2012 there were 2712 voting precincts in virginia alone. Orchestrating a system where you can put a person at a majority of them that will do something nefarious to sway the election means you are looking at 1000 people spread across a not-insignificant amount of land. And that&#x27;s just for one state.</p><p>With an electronic voting system, one bug is all it takes. One vulnerability, one crypto flaw, one guy somewhere that can put the backdoor in the manufacturing of the CPUs for the vote counters. A single person can (if the are very smart and lucky) completely change the outcome of the election. And they might get caught, but the chances are much smaller than if it required thousands of people at the least to do so.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13176818,"story_id":13175388,"children":[]}]}]},{"id":13175940,"created_at_i":1481723907,"type":"comment","author":"lostboys67","text":"<p>When I did poll watching (for knocking up supporters) for Labour a while back we where not allowed in the building and you could not have anything with the candidates name on within 50 or 100 yards - plain rosettes where ok.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13175654,"story_id":13175388,"children":[{"id":13176234,"created_at_i":1481726451,"type":"comment","author":"huxley","text":"<p>Just FYI</p><p>UK: Knocking up - visiting, in this case going door to door to canvass voters</p><p>North America: Knocking up - making pregnant</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13175940,"story_id":13175388,"children":[]}]},{"id":13175797,"created_at_i":1481722433,"type":"comment","author":"VLM","text":"<p>Every state does things a little differently, but where I live paper ballots enter an optical scanner and every dozens&#x2F;hundreds of ballots a subtotal is printed on a continuous stored piece of cash-register like tape.

Opening the code for transparency is a good point (even if this still doesn&#x27;t ensure you that the same version of the code is running in production on trusted hardware), but doing this on GitHub will certainly bring some contributions. Will they refuse everything? Or accept external contributions? Will they use GitHub as the central development process? If not how are they going to handle the development in intern in regards with external contributions? Also are they going to do all commits with this dedicated state-account? Who will be part and what would be the process for reviewing and accepting external contributions, to be sure they are not adding backdors purposely desguised as mistakes? Having a state starting to work on open-sourcing such a sensitive software in Switzerland opens a wide range of interesting questions.

An LLC makes vastly more sense, even for the tiny proportion of companies that want VC funding (and specifically institutional funding - funding from other sources would not matter as much - I&#x27;ll explain why below). Stripe Atlas really ought to make the default an LLC.</p><p>The two major reasons why:</p><p>1. When you&#x27;re a C-corp, you pay taxes twice. Once at the corporate level, and once at the individual level. This matters both for ongoing income but also for any liquidation event - as most liquidation events are asset, not stock, sales, you&#x27;re getting taxed twice here too.</p><p>2. You can go from LLC -&gt; C-corp easily but not the reverse. Why would you make the decision before you have to? Start as an LLC. In the <i>very</i> unlikely event you are taking institutional funding you can convert; in most cases, you&#x27;ll happily stay as an LLC and keep the extra tax dollars you&#x27;d be giving the government.</p><p>Finally - all this business that VCs prefer to invest in Delaware C corps because of the legal knowledge there is - sorry - bullshit. They do it because they <i>have</i> to invest in taxed entities, because they themselves are partnerships so their interest in any flow-through entity will flow up to <i>their</i> investors, some of which are non-profits. Non-profits, like pensions, risk losing their non-profit status if they have unrelated business taxable income. There <i>is</i> a solution here, which is to have a special purpose blocker corp that sits in between the VC partnership and the LLC. This is done <i>all the time</i> in private equity but not in VC and there is no principled reason why not.</p><p>So there you have it. Don&#x27;t do Stripe Atlas because you&#x27;re forcing yourself to make a decision you don&#x27;t need to make right now, that&#x27;s irreversible, and that may end up costing you a lot of money.</p><p>IANAL, but I am a Wharton MBA</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13180312,"story_id":13180312,"children":[{"id":13184005,"created_at_i":1481803515,"type":"comment","author":"weavie","text":"<p>Is it just my ignorance - or is this all much simpler in the UK?</p><p>I think we just have Sole Trade -&gt; Private Limited -&gt; Public Limited and not much other variation.</p><p>Generally anyone starting up will have the choice between Sole Trade (you are personally liable for the companies debts) and Private Limited (you are not personally liable, but have more regulations to abide by such as you have to submit accounts to Companies House.)</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13181296,"story_id":13180312,"children":[{"id":13184308,"created_at_i":1481807297,"type":"comment","author":"GordonS","text":"<p>There is Partnership too, but yes, getting setup as anything other than a public company is very simple.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13184005,"story_id":13180312,"children":[]}]},{"id":13185289,"created_at_i":1481816461,"type":"comment","author":"king_kerr","text":"<p>Awesome and informative.

Our success didn&#x27;t just appear out of nowhere. Aside from that, however, Ithaca has all the makings of a great place for professionals to live.</p><p>There are more restaurants per person here than NYC; the traffic is never bad except during 30-minute rush hour intervals; there is enough middle&#x2F;upper-middle income here to support high-end retail and services (ex: even if there is only one very good spa and steakhouse, it is still a very good spa and steakhouse); the cost of living is...well it&#x27;s ok.  Housing is expensive in the City and the surrounding Town, but if you go a mere 5 minutes out of the Town of Ithaca in any direction you practically pay peanuts.

We have vocational training for this field but the applications to this study has fallen through the floor. Years of influx of polish construction workers have pushed the wages, benefits and status down. Initially the polish immigration was god send because we had serious shortage of construction workers.

We are losing our native competency in this area and we have a lost a whole generation of native Norwegians.</p><p>More regulated professions like plumbers still see strong recruitment. They got higher wages and status. That means schools retain teachers, equipment etc. Getting rid of the guild mentality might make sense in a pure economic sense. But only in the short term IMHO. In the long run you shoot yourself in the foot, because you reduce the attractiveness of the profession. Remember the main problem in the west today isn&#x27;t that people aren&#x27;t able to train for these professions or that the barriers are too high.

All in markets from consumer to aerospace.</p><p>Heck I have a Haas VF2-SS VMC, Bridgeport manual mill, Hardinge lathe, various 3D printers, routers, table saw, half a dozen other saws and metal working equipment and this is only in my house for my hobby and R&amp;D stuff.</p><p>I&#x27;ve been running AutoCAD since inception, Solidworks since inception, CAMWorks, SolidCAM and MasterCAM for some time as well as Siemens NX (exclusively for aerospace stuff).</p><p>So, yeah, I&#x27;ll pat my own back and say I know manufacturing.  Please stop this Silicon Valley &quot;we are going to disrupt manufacturing by making CNC machining easier&quot; nonsense.</p><p>Again, I apologize for being a bit harsh but I have to say you don&#x27;t have a clue.</p><p>OK, here it goes.  I can beat anything you can possible put together.  How? I can send a model to China and have part back in three days flat.  5 axis. Complex. Detailed. Perfectly finished. And reasonably priced. I don&#x27;t even have to know how they make it.  If you work with reputable contract manufacturers out there you get great product at fair prices. It&#x27;s isn&#x27;t that hard. I truly don&#x27;t give a shit what software they use or what machines they might own.

By all means, go for it. But please don&#x27;t say you are going to disrupt manufacturing. CNC machining is a small, very small part of most manufactured products.</p><p>Oh, yeah, did some aluminum die casting, custom extrusions and casting as well.</p><p>Sorry, I&#x27;m pretty tired of the active rejection of experience, existing industry knowledge and existing optimized processes by these Silicon Valley types who are clueless and think everything can be hammered into a software development model.

My understanding is that manufacturing uses more of what we software developers would call a waterfall method of development. Long upfront phase with research and detailed specifications before manufacture. Elon Musk seems to have favored a more software like approach of rapid iterations and feedback. E.g. trying out more risky things, see it break and go back to the drawing board. They also seems to have borrowed the idea of platforms from the software business. Where you gradually refine an established system. E.g. I read that in comparison to other auto manufacturers they create detailed specs for all their parts and fan out the production to all sorts of contractors. These guys might not get used in the next round, in the next model. So you can&#x27;t e.g. gradually refine and upgrade the software systems of the car in the same manner in traditional manufacturing. Mind you I am not doing a great job of explaining these details, if you don&#x27;t know what I am talking about, better to read up other accounts of the differences between Tesla and other auto manufacturers as well as SpaceX and other rocket makers.</p><p>To be fair this isn&#x27;t the same as discussed in this article which is more about what happens at the part level. What Tesla and SpaceX has changed is what happens at the over organizational level. Doing more manufacturing in house and relying on off the shelf parts rather than getting them made according to some spec. E.g. SpaceX uses seatbelts manufactured for race car drivers as their astronaut seatbelts rather than using magnitudes more expensive and custom made astronaut seatbelts.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13183072,"story_id":13177786,"children":[{"id":13207650,"created_at_i":1482095382,"type":"comment","author":"rebootthesystem","text":"<p>I am intimately familiar with the philosophy you describe.</p><p>Let me just say this.  There are certain realities in every business.  If you are baking cookies in your kitchen you can get away with doing things a certain way.  You scoff at the guys making cookies using contract kitchens.  Your ways are better.  Until you hit a certain scale.  Once you hit that scale you&#x27;ll be the one talking to the contract kitchens and you&#x27;ll have to learn and accept the way they work.</p><p>Now you laugh at the folks making cookies in their kitchens and still think the large multinational operations are archaic, old-school, slow and inefficient.</p><p>Until you reach a new scale.  And now you have to make things in the millions.  And the consequences of making mistakes can end your business.  So you seek to learn and adopt the process the large organizations use to reliably manufacture process at a scale you never dreamed of.</p><p>And that&#x27;s when you finally understand and realize things were not really as bad as you thought when you were in the kitchen.  There&#x27;s a &quot;form follows function&quot; reality to manufacturing at different scales.</p><p>Tesla can do things the way they do because their scale allows them to operate this way.  And also because they are making electric cars, which are a LOT easier than gas powered cars.  By switching to an electric motor the complexity of the manufacturing process changes to the extent that eliminating a couple of thousand mechanical components allows.  Electric motors are simple and manufacturing electronic motor controllers is far more efficient than assembling and testing internal combustion engines.</p><p>Yet, if Tesla ever achieves the same scale as a Ford, GM or others it is very likely they will have to operate almost exactly the same way as the large companies do.  You can&#x27;t iterate fast when you are making a million units of a design per year.  Making mistakes can cost your company.  And, when that&#x27;s the context, you go slow, you plan everything, create detailed specifications, recruit and verify suppliers, order things a year in advance, etc.</p><p>With regards to such things as racing seat belts vs. aerospace seat belts, well, it&#x27;s a great way to feel &quot;rogue&quot; and fantastic for press releases.  In the context of a twenty five million dollar rocket and one where the consequence of being &quot;hip&quot; and a maverick is that people die, things, I&#x27;ll be you, are far more like traditional aerospace than not.  Things in aerospace aren&#x27;t expensive just to be expensive.  No, they cost money because the are generally unique, they have to meet certain specification and, in some cases, people&#x27;s lives depend on them.  Just like in Medical.</p><p>Bottom line: You can be a maverick and cut corners when you are in the garage.  As things get &quot;real&quot; you will end-up making pretty much all of the same decisions everyone before you made before you thought everyone was stupid and incompetent.</p><p>And that&#x27;s the problem I have with a lot of these things.  These ridiculous echo chambers starts off assuming everyone before them was stupid and didn&#x27;t know how to innovate (or didn&#x27;t care to).  And that&#x27;s patently false.  Innovation is part of every day engineering.  But it has to be constrained by limitations of the realities within which they exist.</p><p>A book titled &quot;The innovator&#x27;s dilemma&quot; is a great read that covers part of the reason companies are not able to destroy it all and do something different.  Hint: Good management is the reason companies don&#x27;t adopt every possible shift in technology.</p><p>If these guys were talking about making metal-based 3D printing simple and inexpensive and that&#x27;s all they focused on I&#x27;d be singing their praises. If I could buy a metal 3D printer today for, say $50K to $100K, with better throughput, reliability, accuracy and operating cost than compared to a VMC (and the ability to work with a dozen different materials) I&#x27;d be first in line buying half a dozen of them.
