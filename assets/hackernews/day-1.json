This is what Facebook and other companies did after maturing their security programs (see &quot;Facebook Onion&quot; on how Facebook transitioned away from MD5).</p><p>Also good to note - there is evidence Yahoo&#x27;s security culture improved over the years. The decision to go with MD5 almost certainly happened in the 90s, and when Tumblr suffered a breach all users were forced to reset their passwords. The capability and awareness was clearly there.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13180539,"story_id":13180101,"children":[]}]},{"id":13181323,"created_at_i":1481763263,"type":"comment","author":"rconti","text":"<p>You&#x27;re assuming engineering is just sitting on their thumbs, reviewing their code once a week, thinking of ways to optimize it.</p><p>In reality, they&#x27;re constantly under pressure to develop new features, fix reported bugs, move on to the next project, keep the site from falling over, etc etc.</p><p>And the ones who choose NOT to work hard aren&#x27;t sitting around reviewing old code either.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13180454,"story_id":13180101,"children":[]},{"id":13180820,"created_at_i":1481758615,"type":"comment","author":"gottam","text":"<p>Having worked with monolithic legacy codebases that they likely have, it has gone through hundreds of developers who dont work for the company anymore that created a bunch of spaghetti code means its a huge effort required to make sure that none of their other services break when they implement such changes.

For every individual investment they make, the chance of any sort of return is quite low; they make up for this because the rare startups that succeed make enough to compensate for this low success rate. Since they are making a lot of these high risk&#x2F;high reward &#x27;bets&#x27;, they can be fairly assured they will receive the expected value in return.</p><p>As an individual, you only get to place one bet on your employer. For most startup employees, that means they are very unlikely to get any sort of payout because of company success. It doesn&#x27;t matter that the &#x27;expected value&#x27; of working for a more-likely-to-hit-it-big startup is higher than for another company, since the probability is that you will not hit it big.</p><p>As an individual, you are more concerned with things like salary, working conditions, and personal enjoyment of the work. Those are the things you are CERTAINLY going to experience; the tiny chance of huge success is most likely not going to affect you.</p><p>I think there is a good analogy to poker here; in Texas Hold&#x27;em, two aces are the best starting hand.

One such case is if you are playing in a tournament, you are in the money, and two people with much larger stacks have already gone all-in. In that case, your best bet is likely to fold; even though you have the highest odds of winning the hand out of everyone, if you LOSE, you are out and can&#x27;t keep playing. Even if you win, you will still have the smallest stack and are unlikely to move up any spots and win more money; if you fold, though, someone else is likely to be knocked out and you can move up.</p><p>It seems counter intuitive, but this holds because expected value only works as your primary decision making point when you can make many bets; if you only get one bet, lower risk with lower reward is often better for you even if the expected value is lower.</p><p>Think about it this way; lets say you only have $1,000, and you need it to pay your monthly rent (if you don&#x27;t pay, you will be kicked out and be homeless). Someone comes up and offers you a bet; you bet $1000, and you get a 1% chance of winning $200,000. In terms of expected value, this is a great deal!

For what I want out of life, it absolutely made sense for me to move here - even with only $2K in cash, no job, and no place to live at first.</p><p>I came here for the things you can&#x27;t easily put a price on - like the weather, local arts, music, and culture. Also driving into the mountains, or down the coast of California. Chicago is no slouch for fun but cold days like this make me glad I&#x27;m not waiting for the &#x27;L&#x27; outside anymore. SF weather is generally magical.</p><p>Being in a top US city still gets me direct, reasonably priced, and frequently scheduled nonstop flights to family&#x2F;friends in places like Chicago, Cincinnati, Los Angeles, Seattle - not always attainable in some of these smaller tech hubs (like Portland, or Austin.)</p><p>When people move here, there is a constant worry about how much money they will make or what company they work for - I didn&#x27;t sweat it.</p><p>Within a month after arriving, I landed a great career. I spent the last two years exploring other hobbies and interests, and nurturing healthy new friendships.</p><p>Biggest tip I can give - It&#x27;s nice to get to know people who&#x27;ve been around here for a while, they&#x27;ve seen it all before. Show an interest in your local community. Volunteer your time but branch out of tech. Get to know people here in all walks of life; show compassion You just may be liked enough by some old school San Franciscans that refer you to one of their friends; who rent you their old place (with parking and views on Twin Peaks) for $1200. It worked for me.</p><p>San Francisco is not an expensive city because of tech alone, it&#x27;s always been a bit on the expensive side; as there&#x27;s no place in America like it.</p><p>Of course this is my experience. I merely bring it up just as a reminder that there&#x27;s so many things to focus on when decide whether or not moving here is worth it. The questions that guided me in my decision to move here were:</p><p>What are my goals long-term? \nWhat made me decide to move here? \nWhat is my contribution to the local community and society - outside of working in tech? \nWill I ultimately grow as a person; both personally and professionally?\nIs there enough other activities around that will keep me from being bored that I&#x27;ll enjoy?</p><p>My $.02.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13178305,"story_id":13178305,"children":[{"id":13179745,"created_at_i":1481750254,"type":"comment","author":"seikatsu","text":"<p>Hear-hear on &quot;there&#x27;s more to life than money&quot;, but would still argue many of the things you list (&quot;weather, local arts, music, culture&quot;) can be quantified to far larger extent than most bother.</p><p>Here&#x27;s one attempt, as an appropriate illustration for the Bay Area: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;teleport.org&#x2F;cities&#x2F;san-francisco-bay-area&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;teleport.org&#x2F;cities&#x2F;san-francisco-bay-area&#x2F;</a>\n(skip the top for startups, worst for housing and unfold the leisure, culture and tolerance categories, for example).</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13179338,"story_id":13178305,"children":[]},{"id":13179598,"created_at_i":1481749198,"type":"comment","author":"rconti","text":"<p>Well, their entire goal was to determine whether or not it was affordable&#x2F;made financial sense..

There are people counting hundreds or even thousands of votes in every precinct. Then from there they are publicly announced, and then anyone and everyone can tally up the totals.</p><p>The more people that vote, the more precincts there are, so the amount that any one person or place is responsable for (even only partially) is kept small so that mistakes or &quot;bad actors&quot; can only do a very small amount of damage on their own.</p><p>And if you read down in this submission a bit, people are pointing out that some countries (namely Switzerland) not only encourage people to watch ballot boxes and count along, but actually &quot;draft&quot; people to do it similar to a jury-duty kind of thing in the US.</p><p>Also I think you are severely underestimating the difficulty of auditing code. For starters, it completely removes the ability for the vast majority of the population to audit even if they wanted to. non-programmers can&#x27;t read programming. Not to mention the illiterate, the elderly, and anyone else that doesn&#x27;t have the knowledge to be able to read and follow a programming language.</p><p>Then there&#x27;s the amount of time it takes. Watching a ballot box takes the duration of the election day. A day at most. Auditing every inch of a codebase? Months, years, even longer. You can point out that not everyone has to review every single line, but then you are back to letting a fraction of a percent of the population validate the code (and in a ballot box system, you can have everyone validate the process, adding magnitudes more redundancy that something shady will be caught). And what percentage of programmers do you think have a good enough grasp on cryptographic protocols and voting systems to be able to correctly and securely vet a system like this? I&#x27;d be willing to bet good money there are less than a thousand of them in the united states, and by sheer (un)luck at least one of them will be a &quot;bad actor&quot;.</p><p>But probably the biggest thing is that to sway a &quot;paper and pencil&quot; election, you need materials, you need a LOT of people, and all it takes is one person to see what&#x27;s going on and it all collapses. If you&#x27;re really clever, you <i>might</i> be able to get away with changing the outcome of a single precinct, but what about the rest of the county? the state? the nation? In 2012 there were 2712 voting precincts in virginia alone. Orchestrating a system where you can put a person at a majority of them that will do something nefarious to sway the election means you are looking at 1000 people spread across a not-insignificant amount of land. And that&#x27;s just for one state.</p><p>With an electronic voting system, one bug is all it takes. One vulnerability, one crypto flaw, one guy somewhere that can put the backdoor in the manufacturing of the CPUs for the vote counters. A single person can (if the are very smart and lucky) completely change the outcome of the election. And they might get caught, but the chances are much smaller than if it required thousands of people at the least to do so.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13176818,"story_id":13175388,"children":[]}]}]},{"id":13175940,"created_at_i":1481723907,"type":"comment","author":"lostboys67","text":"<p>When I did poll watching (for knocking up supporters) for Labour a while back we where not allowed in the building and you could not have anything with the candidates name on within 50 or 100 yards - plain rosettes where ok.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13175654,"story_id":13175388,"children":[{"id":13176234,"created_at_i":1481726451,"type":"comment","author":"huxley","text":"<p>Just FYI</p><p>UK: Knocking up - visiting, in this case going door to door to canvass voters</p><p>North America: Knocking up - making pregnant</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13175940,"story_id":13175388,"children":[]}]},{"id":13175797,"created_at_i":1481722433,"type":"comment","author":"VLM","text":"<p>Every state does things a little differently, but where I live paper ballots enter an optical scanner and every dozens&#x2F;hundreds of ballots a subtotal is printed on a continuous stored piece of cash-register like tape.

Opening the code for transparency is a good point (even if this still doesn&#x27;t ensure you that the same version of the code is running in production on trusted hardware), but doing this on GitHub will certainly bring some contributions. Will they refuse everything? Or accept external contributions? Will they use GitHub as the central development process? If not how are they going to handle the development in intern in regards with external contributions? Also are they going to do all commits with this dedicated state-account? Who will be part and what would be the process for reviewing and accepting external contributions, to be sure they are not adding backdors purposely desguised as mistakes? Having a state starting to work on open-sourcing such a sensitive software in Switzerland opens a wide range of interesting questions.

An LLC makes vastly more sense, even for the tiny proportion of companies that want VC funding (and specifically institutional funding - funding from other sources would not matter as much - I&#x27;ll explain why below). Stripe Atlas really ought to make the default an LLC.</p><p>The two major reasons why:</p><p>1. When you&#x27;re a C-corp, you pay taxes twice. Once at the corporate level, and once at the individual level. This matters both for ongoing income but also for any liquidation event - as most liquidation events are asset, not stock, sales, you&#x27;re getting taxed twice here too.</p><p>2. You can go from LLC -&gt; C-corp easily but not the reverse. Why would you make the decision before you have to? Start as an LLC. In the <i>very</i> unlikely event you are taking institutional funding you can convert; in most cases, you&#x27;ll happily stay as an LLC and keep the extra tax dollars you&#x27;d be giving the government.</p><p>Finally - all this business that VCs prefer to invest in Delaware C corps because of the legal knowledge there is - sorry - bullshit. They do it because they <i>have</i> to invest in taxed entities, because they themselves are partnerships so their interest in any flow-through entity will flow up to <i>their</i> investors, some of which are non-profits. Non-profits, like pensions, risk losing their non-profit status if they have unrelated business taxable income. There <i>is</i> a solution here, which is to have a special purpose blocker corp that sits in between the VC partnership and the LLC. This is done <i>all the time</i> in private equity but not in VC and there is no principled reason why not.</p><p>So there you have it. Don&#x27;t do Stripe Atlas because you&#x27;re forcing yourself to make a decision you don&#x27;t need to make right now, that&#x27;s irreversible, and that may end up costing you a lot of money.</p><p>IANAL, but I am a Wharton MBA</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13180312,"story_id":13180312,"children":[{"id":13184005,"created_at_i":1481803515,"type":"comment","author":"weavie","text":"<p>Is it just my ignorance - or is this all much simpler in the UK?</p><p>I think we just have Sole Trade -&gt; Private Limited -&gt; Public Limited and not much other variation.</p><p>Generally anyone starting up will have the choice between Sole Trade (you are personally liable for the companies debts) and Private Limited (you are not personally liable, but have more regulations to abide by such as you have to submit accounts to Companies House.)</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13181296,"story_id":13180312,"children":[{"id":13184308,"created_at_i":1481807297,"type":"comment","author":"GordonS","text":"<p>There is Partnership too, but yes, getting setup as anything other than a public company is very simple.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13184005,"story_id":13180312,"children":[]}]},{"id":13185289,"created_at_i":1481816461,"type":"comment","author":"king_kerr","text":"<p>Awesome and informative.

Our success didn&#x27;t just appear out of nowhere. Aside from that, however, Ithaca has all the makings of a great place for professionals to live.</p><p>There are more restaurants per person here than NYC; the traffic is never bad except during 30-minute rush hour intervals; there is enough middle&#x2F;upper-middle income here to support high-end retail and services (ex: even if there is only one very good spa and steakhouse, it is still a very good spa and steakhouse); the cost of living is...well it&#x27;s ok.  Housing is expensive in the City and the surrounding Town, but if you go a mere 5 minutes out of the Town of Ithaca in any direction you practically pay peanuts.

We have vocational training for this field but the applications to this study has fallen through the floor. Years of influx of polish construction workers have pushed the wages, benefits and status down. Initially the polish immigration was god send because we had serious shortage of construction workers.

We are losing our native competency in this area and we have a lost a whole generation of native Norwegians.</p><p>More regulated professions like plumbers still see strong recruitment. They got higher wages and status. That means schools retain teachers, equipment etc. Getting rid of the guild mentality might make sense in a pure economic sense. But only in the short term IMHO. In the long run you shoot yourself in the foot, because you reduce the attractiveness of the profession. Remember the main problem in the west today isn&#x27;t that people aren&#x27;t able to train for these professions or that the barriers are too high.

All in markets from consumer to aerospace.</p><p>Heck I have a Haas VF2-SS VMC, Bridgeport manual mill, Hardinge lathe, various 3D printers, routers, table saw, half a dozen other saws and metal working equipment and this is only in my house for my hobby and R&amp;D stuff.</p><p>I&#x27;ve been running AutoCAD since inception, Solidworks since inception, CAMWorks, SolidCAM and MasterCAM for some time as well as Siemens NX (exclusively for aerospace stuff).</p><p>So, yeah, I&#x27;ll pat my own back and say I know manufacturing.  Please stop this Silicon Valley &quot;we are going to disrupt manufacturing by making CNC machining easier&quot; nonsense.</p><p>Again, I apologize for being a bit harsh but I have to say you don&#x27;t have a clue.</p><p>OK, here it goes.  I can beat anything you can possible put together.  How? I can send a model to China and have part back in three days flat.  5 axis. Complex. Detailed. Perfectly finished. And reasonably priced. I don&#x27;t even have to know how they make it.  If you work with reputable contract manufacturers out there you get great product at fair prices. It&#x27;s isn&#x27;t that hard. I truly don&#x27;t give a shit what software they use or what machines they might own.

By all means, go for it. But please don&#x27;t say you are going to disrupt manufacturing. CNC machining is a small, very small part of most manufactured products.</p><p>Oh, yeah, did some aluminum die casting, custom extrusions and casting as well.</p><p>Sorry, I&#x27;m pretty tired of the active rejection of experience, existing industry knowledge and existing optimized processes by these Silicon Valley types who are clueless and think everything can be hammered into a software development model.

My understanding is that manufacturing uses more of what we software developers would call a waterfall method of development. Long upfront phase with research and detailed specifications before manufacture. Elon Musk seems to have favored a more software like approach of rapid iterations and feedback. E.g. trying out more risky things, see it break and go back to the drawing board. They also seems to have borrowed the idea of platforms from the software business. Where you gradually refine an established system. E.g. I read that in comparison to other auto manufacturers they create detailed specs for all their parts and fan out the production to all sorts of contractors. These guys might not get used in the next round, in the next model. So you can&#x27;t e.g. gradually refine and upgrade the software systems of the car in the same manner in traditional manufacturing. Mind you I am not doing a great job of explaining these details, if you don&#x27;t know what I am talking about, better to read up other accounts of the differences between Tesla and other auto manufacturers as well as SpaceX and other rocket makers.</p><p>To be fair this isn&#x27;t the same as discussed in this article which is more about what happens at the part level. What Tesla and SpaceX has changed is what happens at the over organizational level. Doing more manufacturing in house and relying on off the shelf parts rather than getting them made according to some spec. E.g. SpaceX uses seatbelts manufactured for race car drivers as their astronaut seatbelts rather than using magnitudes more expensive and custom made astronaut seatbelts.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13183072,"story_id":13177786,"children":[{"id":13207650,"created_at_i":1482095382,"type":"comment","author":"rebootthesystem","text":"<p>I am intimately familiar with the philosophy you describe.</p><p>Let me just say this.  There are certain realities in every business.  If you are baking cookies in your kitchen you can get away with doing things a certain way.  You scoff at the guys making cookies using contract kitchens.  Your ways are better.  Until you hit a certain scale.  Once you hit that scale you&#x27;ll be the one talking to the contract kitchens and you&#x27;ll have to learn and accept the way they work.</p><p>Now you laugh at the folks making cookies in their kitchens and still think the large multinational operations are archaic, old-school, slow and inefficient.</p><p>Until you reach a new scale.  And now you have to make things in the millions.  And the consequences of making mistakes can end your business.  So you seek to learn and adopt the process the large organizations use to reliably manufacture process at a scale you never dreamed of.</p><p>And that&#x27;s when you finally understand and realize things were not really as bad as you thought when you were in the kitchen.  There&#x27;s a &quot;form follows function&quot; reality to manufacturing at different scales.</p><p>Tesla can do things the way they do because their scale allows them to operate this way.  And also because they are making electric cars, which are a LOT easier than gas powered cars.  By switching to an electric motor the complexity of the manufacturing process changes to the extent that eliminating a couple of thousand mechanical components allows.  Electric motors are simple and manufacturing electronic motor controllers is far more efficient than assembling and testing internal combustion engines.</p><p>Yet, if Tesla ever achieves the same scale as a Ford, GM or others it is very likely they will have to operate almost exactly the same way as the large companies do.  You can&#x27;t iterate fast when you are making a million units of a design per year.  Making mistakes can cost your company.  And, when that&#x27;s the context, you go slow, you plan everything, create detailed specifications, recruit and verify suppliers, order things a year in advance, etc.</p><p>With regards to such things as racing seat belts vs. aerospace seat belts, well, it&#x27;s a great way to feel &quot;rogue&quot; and fantastic for press releases.  In the context of a twenty five million dollar rocket and one where the consequence of being &quot;hip&quot; and a maverick is that people die, things, I&#x27;ll be you, are far more like traditional aerospace than not.  Things in aerospace aren&#x27;t expensive just to be expensive.  No, they cost money because the are generally unique, they have to meet certain specification and, in some cases, people&#x27;s lives depend on them.  Just like in Medical.</p><p>Bottom line: You can be a maverick and cut corners when you are in the garage.  As things get &quot;real&quot; you will end-up making pretty much all of the same decisions everyone before you made before you thought everyone was stupid and incompetent.</p><p>And that&#x27;s the problem I have with a lot of these things.  These ridiculous echo chambers starts off assuming everyone before them was stupid and didn&#x27;t know how to innovate (or didn&#x27;t care to).  And that&#x27;s patently false.  Innovation is part of every day engineering.  But it has to be constrained by limitations of the realities within which they exist.</p><p>A book titled &quot;The innovator&#x27;s dilemma&quot; is a great read that covers part of the reason companies are not able to destroy it all and do something different.  Hint: Good management is the reason companies don&#x27;t adopt every possible shift in technology.</p><p>If these guys were talking about making metal-based 3D printing simple and inexpensive and that&#x27;s all they focused on I&#x27;d be singing their praises. If I could buy a metal 3D printer today for, say $50K to $100K, with better throughput, reliability, accuracy and operating cost than compared to a VMC (and the ability to work with a dozen different materials) I&#x27;d be first in line buying half a dozen of them.

Having some sort of GPG signing of (image + gps time + gps position) would be valuable, although establishing the trust chain in practice would be quite difficult and requires some serious thought.</p><p>I&#x27;ve thought a bit about this recently, and was excited by this news because it seemed like an opportunity to talk about it.</p><p>So, here goes.</p><p>The obstacle that is most obvious I think, is, &quot;what if someone gets the private key out of the camera, and uses that to sign doctored images?&quot;. This is a serious problem, and I don&#x27;t think it is one that can be solved by software alone. It needs a hardware solution.</p><p>The solution I propose for this, is using the technology used in the ORWL computer <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orwl.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;index.php?title=Main_Page\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orwl.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;index.php?title=Main_Page</a> .</p><p>The ORWL computer has an open source design, and it stores the data on it encrypted, with (as far as I can tell. I am not a security expert.) quite good physical security. It keeps a key stored on a region of the machine where it will be quickly deleted if tampering is detected. It has a security system which is separate from the rest of it, so that the OS being run does not need to worry about the encryption things at all.</p><p>It has sensors to detect a variety of different possible methods of intrusion, such as breaking through a barrier, sudden pressure changes, sudden temperature changes, etc. each of which will cause the decryption key to be quickly deleted. You can check the details on the wiki.</p><p>My idea is to, instead of the key that is stored in this part of memory being used to decrypt and encrypt the data on the hard drive of the ORWL pc, it would store the private key used to sign the images (or video) being recorded by the camera.</p><p>If anyone tried to get at the private key, the private key would be deleted. But the images already signed could still be verified with the public key.</p><p>Two other problems are, how do people know that a given public key corresponds to a camera with a secure system like this? What if someone just generates a keypair and claims that the public key is for one of these cameras? How can people trust that these cameras work as advertised?</p><p>For the confirming that the cameras work as advertised, the solution for this can be inherited from the ORWL pc. Although the ORWL pc is designed to delete the key upon any physical intrusion, it is also designed to be easy to take apart to inspect, and is (almost entirely?) open source. Opening it up to inspect it will of course cause the key to be deleted, but once one puts it back together again, a new key can be generated using a built in hardware Random Number Generator. This solution could, I believe, also work for this proposed camera design. I believe this is a satisfactory solution.</p><p>For the &quot;why should I believe that this public key corresponds to a private key from a properly working camera of this kind?&quot; question, the solution is similar, I think.</p><p>My idea is to use either a tree or web of trust sort of thing. The idea is that an organization could certify such a public key by opening up the camera, performing tests to confirm that it conforms to the specifications, close it back up, and generate the new keypair. This whole process would be recorded by cameras (or a camera) of the same kind. In this way, it could be confirmed that, given that a certain public key corresponds to a secure camera like this, that other public keys were produced by and correspond to other secure cameras like this.</p><p>If there is an exploit in this system, it should not be harder to demonstrate the flaw than to exploit the flaw, because, if one was able to get a public key verified by this system, which did not in fact belong to such a camera, then one could use it to sign something other than an image, and demonstrate the flaw.</p><p>I would appreciate any feedback on this idea.</p><p>If you read it, thank you for taking the time to read it.</p><p>edit:</p><p>apparently, some cameras have had image signing features before, but have not had the physical security to protect the private key, as described in this thread : <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13178138\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13178138</a> .

Tools which leveraged Node&#x27;s debug protocol and Chrome&#x27;s developer tools (node-inspector) for example were started 5 years ago[2]. Most recently some group associated (maybe on?) the Chrome team started creating a cleaner debug protocol and integrating directly with the Chromium project[3].

I write a lot of Flow&#x2F;TypeScript and it has always lagged behind or required me to use bleeding edge versions which were a) free anyway, so my license was unnecessary for that time span, and b) very buggy, which defeats the purpose.

I understand the argument for moving quickly, but projects that use LLVM suffer as a result.</p><p>Basically, any code that uses LLVM bitrots very quickly because the API is (potentially) incompatible on each release. The way that large projects (like Rust [0]) generally deal with this is by sticking close to the bleeding edge of development, and have an established process for integrating changes as they come. But smaller projects just don&#x27;t have the resources to do this.</p><p>KLEE (a symbolic execution engine) appears to be 5 versions behind the newest release [1]. Terra (a language focusing on metaprogramming for high performance) [2] is only one version behind, but the maintainer has since graduated and I&#x27;m worried the community is too small to keep it from bitrotting.</p><p>Nominally the C API is supposed to solve this by being more stable, but it achieves this by exposing a smaller surface area, which means you can&#x27;t do a lot of what you might need to do with this API.</p><p>I&#x27;d like a stable, full-featured API for LLVM. It sounds like they&#x27;re going this way with the bitcode format, and I think they could start to move in this direction with the API as well. When the project was young, the argument was that avoiding stability allowed the developers the flexibility to explore design decisions and make different tradeoffs over time necessary for the long-term health of the code base. I understand that. But this instability makes it essentially impossible to maintain client projects without ongoing effort, and means that small projects almost always bitrot.</p><p>I think we know enough now to develop a pretty decent stable API for LLVM.

The rapid changes in direction that cause the most stress are less prevalent in running than just about any other sport, not even considering the impacts that can occur e.g. in contact sports.  Injury rates are <i>not</i> particularly high in running compared to other sports, and even if that were so you should be careful about confusing correlation with causation.  A lot of people get injured while running mostly because it&#x27;s an incredibly popular form of exercise.

Running isn&#x27;t particularly good for weight loss, but weight loss has little to do with fitness.  Ditto for weight gain, even in the form of muscle.  When it comes to the kind of fitness that actually matters - i.e. developing one&#x27;s heart and lungs to prevent the chronic problems that kill millions every year - only a few kinds of exercise are better than running.

Around age 32 I resolved to finally get in shape, the arthritis was, at this point, mild-to-moderate, still in the knees (now in the hands). Losing the weight and regular exercise (in my case running, which I&#x27;d been doing as part of soccer on the field, but not for distance until this point) greatly improved my arthritis symptoms. The evenings after a run, my knees felt fantastic. Weeks where I skipped, the symptoms returned (no worse than before, just back to &quot;normal&quot;).</p><p>Once the weight was lost, however, the symptoms almost completely went away. This is very much a YMMV situation, but it&#x27;s something to consider.</p><p>Exercising the full range-of-motion of the joint + weight loss can help a lot, even if it is just delaying the inevitable.

Cycling, elliptical, and rowing machines are low-impact cardio and let you exercise your knees range-of-motion pretty effectively. Bodyweight exercises like squats and lunges and similar, done regularly, will also improve the muscles around the knee, which can help.</p><p>Again, for some forms of arthritis this won&#x27;t help or won&#x27;t help as much, but for others (like me) it can be a life changer.

 run, run as fast as you can!</p><p>5.  always list actions triggered from the meeting and follow up on them adamantly with owners assigned before leaving the room.  the meetings where there&#x27;s a lot of talk, but then everyone leaves without clear ownership are a waste of time.</p><p>6.  for developers, it&#x27;s important to recognize that they maybe in &quot;the zone&quot;, so if i must have a meeting with developers, i try to organize this during the beginning or end of the day, meetings during the middle of day tend to break them out of the zone, then they have to context switch back to that deep problem that they were thinking about which would be a huge productivity fail on everyone&#x27;s part.</p><p>7.  keep things concise, we&#x27;re not here to small talk about families or the warriors, do that at the water cooler.  some people use this as an ice breaker to relax the mood, but that is just potentially a cover up for some big shit storm about to happen.</p><p>8.  for the meetings where you&#x27;re trying to pass down information, keep it concise again, ok to reiterate key messaging, believe the shit that you&#x27;re saying, have conviction.</p><p>9.  keep track of time, i hate all the assholes that overrun meeting times, i tend to attend these meetings less and less, if they can&#x27;t prove that they can hold effective meetings then you lose my time.</p><p>10.  know thy audience, what messaging do you want to give, what messaging do you hope they digest, and tailor it, don&#x27;t talk about stuff that 80% of the people don&#x27;t care about, you&#x27;re wasting people&#x27;s time.</p><p>11.  the good ol&#x27; status meeting, everyone and their mother attends to get a feel for what others are working on, but has absolutely no pertinence to what i need to get done or have done.  really keep things high level, this is not your chance to voice your opinion, or give people the illusion that you&#x27;re busy.  just talk about the high level points, if you have stuff to resolve, don&#x27;t do it in the meeting, do it offline, ahead of the meeting.</p><p>12.  prepare well for meetings, i used to think that i could just waltz in and improvise, no, you need to prepare well, if you have a 1h meeting with 5 people, that&#x27;s 6h of company time being spent, almost a full person day spent.  you better be ready and you better get to the point.</p><p>13.  be on time, every minute wasted is amplified by the number of people waiting.  i usually issue punishment for the ones that come in late, sometimes just the latest, sometimes everyone who&#x27;s late, buy coffee, do pushups, whatever it is.</p><p>14.  i have a no phone and laptop policy in my meetings, sure you could be one of those new fangled flower power children that like to take notes on ipad&#x2F;surface, or evernote on your laptop, but don&#x27;t do that.  you should, however, bring in a paper notebook.  i know you have photographic memory, but bring that notebook, means you&#x27;re well prepared and expecting something out of the meeting.  i had a friend that brought his laptop to play nba live to his harvard law school class.  i also had this senior director during a 3 on 1 interview doodle penises on his laptop while the candidate was talking.  there&#x27;s potential for a lot of mistrust in these circumstances.  i think for the meeting owner to project onto a screen is obviously fine, but there&#x27;s nothing concealed.  assholes that answer phone calls or email during my meetings, unless you&#x27;re sre&#x2F;devops, should be banned from meetings.  the goal should be to get out of the meeting as quickly as possible, everyone focused, if you cannot focus then things will drag on.</p><p>15.  avoid meetings if possible...</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13177611,"story_id":13177611,"children":[]},{"id":13182317,"created_at_i":1481774885,"type":"comment","author":"disposablezero","text":"<p>-9) Keep everyone productive and focused... scarcity = prioritization</p><p>-8) Eliminate boat anchors wasting time of previous with non-value-add bullshit.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13177611,"story_id":13177611,"children":[]},{"id":13178995,"created_at_i":1481744347,"type":"comment","author":"scrabble","text":"<p>This is helpful for me.

For a gamer, even if you have 20 cores, it doesn&#x27;t help you because they&#x27;re after <i>speed</i>. For myself, it&#x27;s being able to run several Adobe products doing video editing, photo editing, and graphic design, on all the same machine, at the same time. Think of it as workload vs. speed. Workstations are more <i>powerful</i> and built for heavy workloads, whereas gaming PC&#x27;s are mainly built for <i>speed</i>.</p><p>And yes, the main application is in crunching big data sets, CAD design, or anything heavy on the graphical side of things.

Standard RAM uses banks of eight memory chips in which data is stored and provided to the CPU on demand. ECC RAM is different as it has an additional memory chip which acts as both error detection and correction for the other eight RAM chips.</i></p><p>In practice, I can say it for sure helps your system to be a lot more reliable and stable. I&#x27;ve been running my workstation for several years without a power cycle and its been rock solid, no issues, no hiccups, no nothing. As such, this is the main advantage of workstations is their reliability. I also like the idea in some models of stuffing up to 128GB of RAM or running dual video cards.</p><p>In the end, with so many people opting for laptops and gaming systems, you can get your hands on a hell of a workforce PC for under $500. The processors and video card are still dirt cheap (around $100). The only mildly expensive stuff is the RAM. I&#x27;ve really good luck with the HP workstations, but that&#x27;s just me.

To its credit, eBay refunded to me the shipping charges both ways that I had paid.

Have accumulated 200 feedbacks and currently at 100% positive. But I have entertained closing my account a few times in past two years and have started to cut back drastically on ebay as both a buyer and especially a seller.</p><p>First, as others have mentioned, they have a monopolistic marketplace where they require one to use their own Paypal for transactions. The combined fee&#x27;s for selling on ebay + Paypal now are 10% of the final sold amount + the shipping amount. Where margins are slim as it is and things are already selling well below their value at times because of so many other competing auctions, the fee&#x27;s make it not worth it in many cases. They are making a boatload in fees and I&#x27;m tired of it. I just sold $400 golf clubs and had to give them $42? Ebay provides value as the market is so large. I had those clubs on Craigslist for TWO months and not even a inquiry at that price. Ebay got sold in 7 day auction. But to pay 10% for everything is too greedy imo. They have NO competition.</p><p>Second, ebay has become a haven for scammers and overrun with them to point I am leery of purchasing anything like electronics, phones, etc on there. Software..forget it! DO NOT buy any licensed software from ebay no matter how good buyer feedback. Even if it claims new&#x2F;sealed. The pirates have gotten too good. I&#x27;d venture to say 99% of software on there now is either a)counterfeit from get go or b)legit but &quot;used&quot; and&#x2F;or illegal Volume Licenses. The problem is key will work when you get it but fail 5 months from now or when you need to reinstall. I&#x27;ve been victim of this two times now and NO more will I buy software off ebay. When it does fail, it is long enough you have zero recourse. Ebay you can&#x27;t even file a claim as they give you only like 14 days after purchase. A pirate knows this and gets keys from a keygen. I had 8 legit looking MS Office licenses in sealed retail boxes register then 4 months later started to fail. Called Microsoft and they told me I had registered them too many times and they are now flagged. Huh? I only installed them ONCE. Credit card company didn&#x27;t even help as it was past the time limit for a case. So basically the seller sold many of the same key and whoever bought from him, who knows how many of us, they are all worthless. Really upsets me that ebay allows ANY software even on there. They clearly know that this must be going on. I tried to inform them of the practice but couldn&#x27;t even find a contact to let know. They don&#x27;t care as they are making their fees! Tons of them from software. Their only concern is a small webpage to help identify counterfeit. From now on, I will only buy hard items that can&#x27;t be counterfeited or scammed easily, like golf clubs.</p><p>Third, as this story is about, ebay is WAY to buyer-centric and I too was once bitten by similar story as topic starter. Not as blatantly bad as the OP or that amount of money, but bad enough I was pissed. Eventually also got someone from ebay on the phone and as similar was brushed off and there was no pleading my case. End of story, refund the money. It cost me out of my own pocket by time it was returned and settled.</p>","points":null,"parent_id":13180885,"story_id":13180885,"children":[]},{"id":13201863,"created_at_i":1482000907,"type":"comment","author":"silverdrake11","text":"<p>UPDATE: It looks like eBay refunded him because of the reaction here on HN</p><p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;matthewsag.com&#x2F;?p=1649\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;matthewsag.com&#x2F;?p=1649</a></p>","points":null,"parent_id":13180885,"story_id":13180885,"children":[]},{"id":13181130,"created_at_i":1481761556,"type":"comment","author":"ignorantguy","text":"<p>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend ebay to anyone at all.

I was a seller of lots of random (and sometimes very expensive) things (mostly collectibles) on Ebay for many years.  I had 100% feedback, often going out of my way (and taking a small loss) to deal with crazy and&#x2F;or difficult people in order to keep my perfect feedback status.</p><p>I would pinpoint the time Ebay went off the rails to many years ago, when they changed their feedback system.  The whole beauty of Ebay was that it was based on reputation.  If I was selling something for thousands of dollars, I would only allow buyers that had plenty of good feedback.  This simple system allowed you to avoid 99% of scammers.  The only scammers that got through were people who spent a long time acting legit and building up lots of positive feedback, then &quot;going rogue&quot; and using that built-up goodwill to pull off a scam.  This risk was small and worth taking (happened to me twice after hundreds of sales).</p><p>At some point, though, Ebay changed their feedback system so that sellers could not leave buyers negative feedback!  You could only leave positive feedback, or refuse to leave feedback at all.  Overnight, the entire reputation-based system of buyer&#x2F;seller reputation was destroyed.  Within three months of the change I was hit by three scammers, after selling less then ten total items.  This was more scammers than I had to deal with in a decade of prior Ebay sales.  There was simply no way for me to figure out which buyers were legit, and no way to warn other sellers which buyers were scammers.  As evidenced in the article above, Ebay has absolutely no interest in blocking these scammers.  Contacting Ebay inevitably results in a canned response that has nothing to do with your issue.  Shortly after they changed their feedback system I stopped selling on Ebay all together.

For one, you were able to set up filters to filter out anyone below a certain amount of feedbacks or anyone with X number of negative feedbacks from bidding on your item.  Obviously by eliminating the ability to leave negative feedback to buyers eliminates this.</p><p>You could also cancel the bids of buyers and offer the item to a different bidder if they violated the terms of the sale (or didn&#x27;t pay).  As absurd as it sounds, someone can bid on your item, not pay, and still leave you a negative feedback. For example, they place the &quot;winning bid&quot;.  After the auction ends (and before they pay) they contact you and tell you they want the item shipped to Nigeria.  Even if Nigeria isn&#x27;t listed as a place you sell too, and you explicitly point out in the item description that you don&#x27;t ship out of country, they can still leave you a negative feedback - all without paying!  In the past buyers were hesitant to due that, because they&#x27;d certainly receive a negative feedback in return.

At the time, you could have a non-business account, accept no-fee bank-funded payments from buyers. But if you wanted to accept credit-cards <i>at all</i>, you had to switch your Paypal to a business membership and then pay fees on <i>every</i> transaction regardless of funding source. So, they said &quot;you can&#x27;t sell without accepting Paypal, you can&#x27;t limit the payment options, therefore you can&#x27;t sell on eBay without a <i>business</i> level PayPal account <i>and</i> pay the fees that go with it&quot;.</p><p>It was so obviously corrupt and bullshit and undermining their basic platform function of connecting buyers and sellers.

Sadly, cut-throat businesses win.</p><p>I recently took an Uber ride, where the driver was an un-retired man in his 70s. He recently just abandoned his failing dry clean business. This one hits close to home for me, because my parents are approaching their 70s, holding on to a failing dry clean business, too. For me, hardworking people like this, with arguably bad business acumen, are counter example to the notion of &quot;if you&#x27;re poor, it&#x27;s because you didn&#x27;t work hard enough.&quot; Before the dry clean business, the Uber driver ran a deli business, but that was a failure, too. No doubt he possesses an entrepreneurial spirit, albeit he probably shouldn&#x27;t.  I can&#x27;t fault him for not being smarter. He proceeded to tell me about his idea to create a website where people upload images of their face, at different angle, and can get a custom printed 3d figurine, that he would hand paint them. I didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell him that as someone in the top 1% income bracket of 20-something year olds, who consistently blows money on expensive toys &#x2F; gadgets &#x2F; dinners, I would never spend $300 bucks on a custom painted figurine. See, he was an artist before coming to America. He said &quot;I want to be an artist before I die. I was too busy making a living when I came to America&quot;.</p><p>Uber gave this man a job. That&#x27;s good. But he&#x27;s being paid near minimum wage. To achieve that, he has to work 12+ hour days to acquire the bonuses that Uber uses to incentivize their drivers to become addicted. These are the kinds of risk Uber induces on its drivers, customers, and other people on the road. The sad reality is, he&#x27;s going to be displaced from this minimum wage job by automation, much earlier than people expect. Uber doesn&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m not saying Uber or any private company MUST care. I&#x27;m just illustrating how a company&#x27;s values permeates itself, and precipitates to individuals&#x27; livelihoods.</p><p>I recently read an article about the unit economics of Uber. It doesn&#x27;t work out. Uber, in it&#x27;s current form is based on leveraging free VC money to subsidize and incentivize somewhat artificial demand. It&#x27;s predatory monopolistic tactics. They won&#x27;t be able to live up to their unicorn IPO valuation hype. They NEED to expand into other domains. Recently, Uber acquired an A.I. startup, which I think is an indicator of this. Alternatively, they can fix the unit economics equation to be profitable. Autonomous vehicles is the purported answer.
